# 0.7.2

-   Support IE11 without polyfills and transpiling.

# 0.7.1

-   Fix a TypeError in table diff, which occured when THEAD or TFOOT was added or removed, and a column was removed.

# 0.7.0

-   Add `diffText` option.
-   Fix table diffs. If a table can't be diffed correctly, both the old and new tables are added to the diff result with "vdd-removed" and "vdd-added" classes respectively.

# 0.6.0

-   BREAKING CHANGE: Mark up the added and removed elements by adding the `vdd-added` and `vdd-removed` classes to the affected elements, instead of using the `<INS>` and `<DEL>` wrappers. Text and formatting changes still use the `<INS>` and `<DEL>` wrappers.
-   BREAKING CHANGE: Mark up structural elements (P, TABLE, DIV, etc) with modified attributes by adding the `vdd-modified` class to the affected elements, instead of outputting 2 elements with `vdd-added` and `vdd-removed` classes. Attribute changes on content elements (eg. IMG, IFRAME, SVG, etc) still output 2 elements with the `vdd-added` and `vdd-removed` classes. Formatting elements (eg STRONG, EM, etc) are unafected by this change.
-   Fix invalid characters sometimes appearing in diff results.
-   Improve table diffs by preferring cell content changes to cell removals and additions.

# 0.5.2
