              "body": "# Let’s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations\n\n## Abstract\n\n[proposals.app](https://proposals.app) proposes a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO to enhance the usability of this governance forum, so that delegates, tokenholders, and forum readers can have more context and information about our DAO proposals. We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of one year, for a total of **$60,000 USD**.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently, DAO governance remains a disjointed, messy, and confusing experience for delegates and tokenholders.** We believe that one of the main reasons for this is the clear lack of foundational DAO tooling that prioritizes true composability and aggregates data from multiple (even competing) offchain and onchain sources, thereby providing a more comprehensive and enjoyable user experience for DAO delegates and tokenholders. We believe that to achieve this, DAO tools should be free and open-source, operate under a non-profit entity that ideally has public financial records of its operations. At proposals.app, we strive to uphold these beliefs.\n\n[Andrei](https://andreiv.com) and I have been building DAO tools since mid-2023, starting with [Senate](https://x.com/SenateLabs), where we previously piloted two forum integrations (one with [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044), and another with [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680)), and more recently, we’ve been working on [proposals.app](https://x.com/proposalsapp), where we’ve developed dedicated tooling for Arbitrum DAO’s governance needs that was funded through [a questbook grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) last October. More specifically, we’ve designed and developed a [unified governance aggregator](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-proposals-app-govhack-brussels-winner/25370) that brings together, under the same platform, the discourse forum comments and both offchain and onchain votes, so that delegates can access the complete history of every proposal in Arbitrum DAO. We launched it publicly on April 5ᵗʰ at ETH Bucharest 2025, and you can check it out at [arbitrum.proposals.app](https://arbitrum.proposals.app) and share your thoughts about it with us in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/+U9QrY4L8wfNiMzA8).\n\nWe’re now proposing **a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO** to bring some of the exclusive proposals.app features we have in our app, to this governance forum. **We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum**, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of 12 months.\n\n![Demo of the three proposals.app feature integrations](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7e148a110ffeb8388f8bccdee73242f41437c45d.gif)\n\nWe believe that **these three features will enhance usability and accessibility** in this governance forum for all users, regardless of their level of maturity.\n\nThese three features, as demonstrated above, are:\n\n1. **Live Votes** – Show the live or latest vote at the top of the page for each forum topic in the proposals category\n2. **Voting Power Tags** – Show the voting power of each delegate, under their username, for every comment on the forum\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – Provide a way for forum visitors to subscribe to email notifications, receiving an email every time a new discussion is started, when an offchain or onchain vote begins, and when its voting period is nearing completion.\n\nWith these three proposals.app feature integrations in this forum, we believe will see **bigger governance participation and better engagement in discussions**, from a more diverse set of delegates and tokenholders, who will have more context about who is commenting on what, about when proposals are up to a vote and where and when to vote in each moment of the proposal lifecycle.\n\nWe shared a short demo of proposals.app and these three proposed feature integrations on the [Open Governance Call on June 3rd](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/june-3-2025-open-discussion-of-proposals-governance-call/29377?u=paulofonseca), and you can see the recording of that demo and presentation, as well as some Q&A, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MToHsWqQxs).\n\n## Rationale\n\nConstantly improving and caring for the governance processes in Arbitrum DAO is essential to maintain a healthy, engaged, resilient, and decentralized DAO. In Arbitrum DAO’s case, where tokenholders and delegates actually have on-chain control over protocol upgrades and treasury spending, it becomes even more critical that **they vote with as much context and information as possible in each and every vote.**\n\nAdditionally, **in token-weighted voting DAOs, not all voices carry the same weight.** Powerful delegates commenting and giving feedback on proposals are crucial signals of support. On the other hand, newly created forum accounts with no voting power, which are becoming more prevalent in the age of AI, make way more noise than signal and disrupt the discussion flow. Proposers and readers should be able to distinguish between the two and everything in between, much more easily.\n\nAs stated in [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), we should strive to follow our stated Community Values, and specifically:\n\n> **Neutral and open:** Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.\n\nWe believe it’s essential for Arbitrum DAO to have multiple governance platforms available to its tokenholders, delegates, and voters, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them with tools that suit their particular needs and help them engage in governance in an easier and clearer way.\n\nWe also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. Regarding the obvious matter of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue participating in governance permissionlessly. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) [is fully open source](https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp) and will continue to be. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** – Showing discourse users’ voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token** and **maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets** on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** – In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot’s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a “Setup Proposal Notifications” button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the **Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the **Proposal Notification Emails** integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**. After a successful offchain vote, we will move this proposal and publish an **onchain vote on Monday, June 23rd**, to start the voting period on Thursday, June 26th.\n\n===\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, we can kick off this work and start the timeline proposed above, **as early as July 15th.**\n\n===\n\nThis would mean that we could deliver all of the proposed scope, 1 month later, **on August 15th**.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nWe propose to build, maintain, and host these three feature integrations for Arbitrum for a minimum of 12 months. The total cost to the Arbitrum DAO, is **$60,000 USD**.\n\nHere is the cost breakdown:\n\n| Item | Amount |\n| ------------------- | ------: |\n| **Maintenance** 1 year (1 day of Design + 1 day of Development + 1 day of Testing, per month) | $48,000 USD |\n| **Hosting** 1 year (3 Servers, DNS, and Emails) | $12,000 USD |\n| **Total** | **$60,000 USD** |\n\nThe **Maintenance** fee includes 1 day per month of Design, 1 day per month of Development, and 1 day per month of Testing, to ensure we maintain these features with an up-to-date user experience and quality of service, and that we can incorporate the delegates’ future feedback on these proposals.app feature integrations.\n\nThe **Hosting** fee includes the monthly costs for all the infrastructure we use, which can be live-monitored on [status.proposals.app](https://status.proposals.app/).\n\nWe propose that the payment be done as a one-time payment of $60,000 USD.\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, the funds should be transferred either to **the MSS or the Arbitrum Foundation** (depending on the outcome of the current [Wind Down the MSS](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wind-down-the-mss-transfer-payment-responsibilities-to-the-arbitrum-foundation/29279) proposal), which would certify the delivery of the three feature integrations and release the payment after a successful deployment.\n\n## Pledge\n\nAndrei and Paulo pledge to continually work towards a future where DAO governance tools are genuinely credibly neutral. Therefore, our work is [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErD4sHs2Zk&list=PLaYDaaHm0oQGefGFDg8dt77ce7MQaUghG), fully [open-source](https://github.com/proposals-app), and happens with transparent [financials](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E). Additionally, proposals.app will soon be established as a non-profit entity, and we pledge never to accept venture capital funding. Until now, proposals.app has only received [a $43,000 USD grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) from Arbitrum DAO via Season 2 of the Domain Allocator grants on Questbook, as well as $6,000 USD for the first-place prize in the Arbitrum GovHack at ETHcc Brussels. No other funding, from any other source, was received, as shown in our [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E).\n\n## 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal through to the end.",

            "body": "# Let’s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations\n\n## Abstract\n\n[proposals.app](https://proposals.app) proposes a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO to enhance the usability of this governance forum, so that delegates, tokenholders, and forum readers can have more context and information about our DAO proposals. We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of one year, for a total of **$60,000 USD**.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently, DAO governance remains a disjointed, messy, and confusing experience for delegates and tokenholders.** We believe that one of the main reasons for this is the clear lack of foundational DAO tooling that prioritizes true composability and aggregates data from multiple (even competing) offchain and onchain sources, thereby providing a more comprehensive and enjoyable user experience for DAO delegates and tokenholders. We believe that to achieve this, DAO tools should be free and open-source, operate under a non-profit entity that ideally has public financial records of its operations. At proposals.app, we strive to uphold these beliefs.\n\n[Andrei](https://andreiv.com) and I have been building DAO tools since mid-2023, starting with [Senate](https://x.com/SenateLabs), where we previously piloted two forum integrations (one with [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044), and another with [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680)), and more recently, we’ve been working on [proposals.app](https://x.com/proposalsapp), where we’ve developed dedicated tooling for Arbitrum DAO’s governance needs that was funded through [a questbook grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) last October. More specifically, we’ve designed and developed a [unified governance aggregator](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-proposals-app-govhack-brussels-winner/25370) that brings together, under the same platform, the discourse forum comments and both offchain and onchain votes, so that delegates can access the complete history of every proposal in Arbitrum DAO. We launched it publicly on April 5ᵗʰ at ETH Bucharest 2025, and you can check it out at [arbitrum.proposals.app](https://arbitrum.proposals.app) and share your thoughts about it with us in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/+U9QrY4L8wfNiMzA8).\n\nWe’re now proposing **a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO** to bring some of the exclusive proposals.app features we have in our app, to this governance forum. **We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum**, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of 12 months.\n\n![Demo of the three proposals.app feature integrations](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7e148a110ffeb8388f8bccdee73242f41437c45d.gif)\n\nWe believe that **these three features will enhance usability and accessibility** in this governance forum for all users, regardless of their level of maturity.\n\nThese three features, as demonstrated above, are:\n\n1. **Live Votes** – Show the live or latest vote at the top of the page for each forum topic in the proposals category\n2. **Voting Power Tags** – Show the voting power of each delegate, under their username, for every comment on the forum\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – Provide a way for forum visitors to subscribe to email notifications, receiving an email every time a new discussion is started, when an offchain or onchain vote begins, and when its voting period is nearing completion.\n\nWith these three proposals.app feature integrations in this forum, we believe will see **bigger governance participation and better engagement in discussions**, from a more diverse set of delegates and tokenholders, who will have more context about who is commenting on what, about when proposals are up to a vote and where and when to vote in each moment of the proposal lifecycle.\n\nWe shared a short demo of proposals.app and these three proposed feature integrations on the [Open Governance Call on June 3rd](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/june-3-2025-open-discussion-of-proposals-governance-call/29377?u=paulofonseca), and you can see the recording of that demo and presentation, as well as some Q&A, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MToHsWqQxs).\n\n## Rationale\n\nConstantly improving and caring for the governance processes in Arbitrum DAO is essential to maintain a healthy, engaged, resilient, and decentralized DAO. In Arbitrum DAO’s case, where tokenholders and delegates actually have on-chain control over protocol upgrades and treasury spending, it becomes even more critical that **they vote with as much context and information as possible in each and every vote.**\n\nAdditionally, **in token-weighted voting DAOs, not all voices carry the same weight.** Powerful delegates commenting and giving feedback on proposals are crucial signals of support. On the other hand, newly created forum accounts with no voting power, which are becoming more prevalent in the age of AI, make way more noise than signal and disrupt the discussion flow. Proposers and readers should be able to distinguish between the two and everything in between, much more easily.\n\nAs stated in [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), we should strive to follow our stated Community Values, and specifically:\n\n> **Neutral and open:** Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.\n\nWe believe it’s essential for Arbitrum DAO to have multiple governance platforms available to its tokenholders, delegates, and voters, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them with tools that suit their particular needs and help them engage in governance in an easier and clearer way.\n\nWe also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. Regarding the obvious matter of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue participating in governance permissionlessly. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) [is fully open source](https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp) and will continue to be. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** – Showing discourse users’ voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token** and **maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets** on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** – In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot’s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a “Setup Proposal Notifications” button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the **Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the **Proposal Notification Emails** integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**. After a successful offchain vote, we will move this proposal and publish an **onchain vote on Monday, June 23rd**, to start the voting period on Thursday, June 26th.\n\n===\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, we can kick off this work and start the timeline proposed above, **as early as July 15th.**\n\n===\n\nThis would mean that we could deliver all of the proposed scope, 1 month later, **on August 15th**.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nWe propose to build, maintain, and host these three feature integrations for Arbitrum for a minimum of 12 months. The total cost to the Arbitrum DAO, is **$60,000 USD**.\n\nHere is the cost breakdown:\n\n| Item | Amount |\n| ------------------- | ------: |\n| **Maintenance** 1 year (1 day of Design + 1 day of Development + 1 day of Testing, per month) | $48,000 USD |\n| **Hosting** 1 year (3 Servers, DNS, and Emails) | $12,000 USD |\n| **Total** | **$60,000 USD** |\n\nThe **Maintenance** fee includes 1 day per month of Design, 1 day per month of Development, and 1 day per month of Testing, to ensure we maintain these features with an up-to-date user experience and quality of service, and that we can incorporate the delegates’ future feedback on these proposals.app feature integrations.\n\nThe **Hosting** fee includes the monthly costs for all the infrastructure we use, which can be live-monitored on [status.proposals.app](https://status.proposals.app/).\n\nWe propose that the payment be done as a one-time payment of $60,000 USD.\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, the funds should be transferred either to **the MSS or the Arbitrum Foundation** (depending on the outcome of the current [Wind Down the MSS](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wind-down-the-mss-transfer-payment-responsibilities-to-the-arbitrum-foundation/29279) proposal), which would certify the delivery of the three feature integrations and release the payment after a successful deployment.\n\n## Pledge\n\nAndrei and Paulo pledge to continually work towards a future where DAO governance tools are genuinely credibly neutral. Therefore, our work is [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErD4sHs2Zk&list=PLaYDaaHm0oQGefGFDg8dt77ce7MQaUghG), fully [open-source](https://github.com/proposals-app), and happens with transparent [financials](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E). Additionally, proposals.app will soon be established as a non-profit entity, and we pledge never to accept venture capital funding. Until now, proposals.app has only received [a $43,000 USD grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) from Arbitrum DAO via Season 2 of the Domain Allocator grants on Questbook, as well as $6,000 USD for the first-place prize in the Arbitrum GovHack at ETHcc Brussels. No other funding, from any other source, was received, as shown in our [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E).\n\n## 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal through to the end.",

[proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** – Showing discourse users’ voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token** and **maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets** on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** – In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot’s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a “Setup Proposal Notifications” button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the **Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the **Proposal Notification Emails** integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**. After a successful offchain vote, we will move this proposal and publish an **onchain vote on Monday, June 23rd**, to start the voting period on Thursday, June 26th.\n\n===\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, we can kick off this work and start the timeline proposed above, **as early as July 15th.**\n\n===\n\nThis would mean that we could deliver all of the proposed scope, 1 month later, **on August 15th**.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nWe propose to build, maintain, and host these three feature integrations for Arbitrum for a minimum of 12 months. The total cost to the Arbitrum DAO, is **$60,000 USD**.\n\nHere is the cost breakdown:\n\n| Item | Amount |\n| ------------------- | ------: |\n| **Maintenance** 1 year (1 day of Design + 1 day of Development + 1 day of Testing, per month) | $48,000 USD |\n| **Hosting** 1 year (3 Servers, DNS, and Emails) | $12,000 USD |\n| **Total** | **$60,000 USD** |\n\nThe **Maintenance** fee includes 1 day per month of Design, 1 day per month of Development, and 1 day per month of Testing, to ensure we maintain these features with an up-to-date user experience and quality of service, and that we can incorporate the delegates’ future feedback on these proposals.app feature integrations.\n\nThe **Hosting** fee includes the monthly costs for all the infrastructure we use, which can be live-monitored on [status.proposals.app](https://status.proposals.app/).\n\nWe propose that the payment be done as a one-time payment of $60,000 USD.\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, the funds should be transferred either to **the MSS or the Arbitrum Foundation** (depending on the outcome of the current [Wind Down the MSS](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wind-down-the-mss-transfer-payment-responsibilities-to-the-arbitrum-foundation/29279) proposal), which would certify the delivery of the three feature integrations and release the payment after a successful deployment.\n\n## Pledge\n\nAndrei and Paulo pledge to continually work towards a future where DAO governance tools are genuinely credibly neutral. Therefore, our work is [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErD4sHs2Zk&list=PLaYDaaHm0oQGefGFDg8dt77ce7MQaUghG), fully [open-source](https://github.com/proposals-app), and happens with transparent [financials](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E). Additionally, proposals.app will soon be established as a non-profit entity, and we pledge never to accept venture capital funding. Until now, proposals.app has only received [a $43,000 USD grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) from Arbitrum DAO via Season 2 of the Domain Allocator grants on Questbook, as well as $6,000 USD for the first-place prize in the Arbitrum GovHack at ETHcc Brussels. No other funding, from any other source, was received, as shown in our [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E).\n\n## 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal through to the end.",

          "body": "# Let’s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations\n\n## Abstract\n\n[proposals.app](https://proposals.app) proposes a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO to enhance the usability of this governance forum, so that delegates, tokenholders, and forum readers can have more context and information about our DAO proposals. We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of one year, for a total of **$60,000 USD**.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently, DAO governance remains a disjointed, messy, and confusing experience for delegates and tokenholders.** We believe that one of the main reasons for this is the clear lack of foundational DAO tooling that prioritizes true composability and aggregates data from multiple (even competing) offchain and onchain sources, thereby providing a more comprehensive and enjoyable user experience for DAO delegates and tokenholders. We believe that to achieve this, DAO tools should be free and open-source, operate under a non-profit entity that ideally has public financial records of its operations. At proposals.app, we strive to uphold these beliefs.\n\n[Andrei](https://andreiv.com) and I have been building DAO tools since mid-2023, starting with [Senate](https://x.com/SenateLabs), where we previously piloted two forum integrations (one with [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044), and another with [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680)), and more recently, we’ve been working on [proposals.app](https://x.com/proposalsapp), where we’ve developed dedicated tooling for Arbitrum DAO’s governance needs that was funded through [a questbook grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) last October. More specifically, we’ve designed and developed a [unified governance aggregator](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-proposals-app-govhack-brussels-winner/25370) that brings together, under the same platform, the discourse forum comments and both offchain and onchain votes, so that delegates can access the complete history of every proposal in Arbitrum DAO. We launched it publicly on April 5ᵗʰ at ETH Bucharest 2025, and you can check it out at [arbitrum.proposals.app](https://arbitrum.proposals.app) and share your thoughts about it with us in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/+U9QrY4L8wfNiMzA8).\n\nWe’re now proposing **a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO** to bring some of the exclusive proposals.app features we have in our app, to this governance forum. **We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum**, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of 12 months.\n\n![Demo of the three proposals.app feature integrations](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7e148a110ffeb8388f8bccdee73242f41437c45d.gif)\n\nWe believe that **these three features will enhance usability and accessibility** in this governance forum for all users, regardless of their level of maturity.\n\nThese three features, as demonstrated above, are:\n\n1. **Live Votes** – Show the live or latest vote at the top of the page for each forum topic in the proposals category\n2. **Voting Power Tags** – Show the voting power of each delegate, under their username, for every comment on the forum\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – Provide a way for forum visitors to subscribe to email notifications, receiving an email every time a new discussion is started, when an offchain or onchain vote begins, and when its voting period is nearing completion.\n\nWith these three proposals.app feature integrations in this forum, we believe will see **bigger governance participation and better engagement in discussions**, from a more diverse set of delegates and tokenholders, who will have more context about who is commenting on what, about when proposals are up to a vote and where and when to vote in each moment of the proposal lifecycle.\n\nWe shared a short demo of proposals.app and these three proposed feature integrations on the [Open Governance Call on June 3rd](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/june-3-2025-open-discussion-of-proposals-governance-call/29377?u=paulofonseca), and you can see the recording of that demo and presentation, as well as some Q&A, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MToHsWqQxs).\n\n## Rationale\n\nConstantly improving and caring for the governance processes in Arbitrum DAO is essential to maintain a healthy, engaged, resilient, and decentralized DAO. In Arbitrum DAO’s case, where tokenholders and delegates actually have on-chain control over protocol upgrades and treasury spending, it becomes even more critical that **they vote with as much context and information as possible in each and every vote.**\n\nAdditionally, **in token-weighted voting DAOs, not all voices carry the same weight.** Powerful delegates commenting and giving feedback on proposals are crucial signals of support. On the other hand, newly created forum accounts with no voting power, which are becoming more prevalent in the age of AI, make way more noise than signal and disrupt the discussion flow. Proposers and readers should be able to distinguish between the two and everything in between, much more easily.\n\nAs stated in [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), we should strive to follow our stated Community Values, and specifically:\n\n> **Neutral and open:** Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.\n\nWe believe it’s essential for Arbitrum DAO to have multiple governance platforms available to its tokenholders, delegates, and voters, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them with tools that suit their particular needs and help them engage in governance in an easier and clearer way.\n\nWe also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. Regarding the obvious matter of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue participating in governance permissionlessly. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) [is fully open source](https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp) and will continue to be. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** – Showing discourse users’ voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token** and **maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets** on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** – In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot’s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a “Setup Proposal Notifications” button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the **Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the **Proposal Notification Emails** integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**. After a successful offchain vote, we will move this proposal and publish an **onchain vote on Monday, June 23rd**, to start the voting period on Thursday, June 26th.\n\n===\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, we can kick off this work and start the timeline proposed above, **as early as July 15th.**\n\n===\n\nThis would mean that we could deliver all of the proposed scope, 1 month later, **on August 15th**.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nWe propose to build, maintain, and host these three feature integrations for Arbitrum for a minimum of 12 months. The total cost to the Arbitrum DAO, is **$60,000 USD**.\n\nHere is the cost breakdown:\n\n| Item | Amount |\n| ------------------- | ------: |\n| **Maintenance** 1 year (1 day of Design + 1 day of Development + 1 day of Testing, per month) | $48,000 USD |\n| **Hosting** 1 year (3 Servers, DNS, and Emails) | $12,000 USD |\n| **Total** | **$60,000 USD** |\n\nThe **Maintenance** fee includes 1 day per month of Design, 1 day per month of Development, and 1 day per month of Testing, to ensure we maintain these features with an up-to-date user experience and quality of service, and that we can incorporate the delegates’ future feedback on these proposals.app feature integrations.\n\nThe **Hosting** fee includes the monthly costs for all the infrastructure we use, which can be live-monitored on [status.proposals.app](https://status.proposals.app/).\n\nWe propose that the payment be done as a one-time payment of $60,000 USD.\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, the funds should be transferred either to **the MSS or the Arbitrum Foundation** (depending on the outcome of the current [Wind Down the MSS](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wind-down-the-mss-transfer-payment-responsibilities-to-the-arbitrum-foundation/29279) proposal), which would certify the delivery of the three feature integrations and release the payment after a successful deployment.\n\n## Pledge\n\nAndrei and Paulo pledge to continually work towards a future where DAO governance tools are genuinely credibly neutral. Therefore, our work is [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErD4sHs2Zk&list=PLaYDaaHm0oQGefGFDg8dt77ce7MQaUghG), fully [open-source](https://github.com/proposals-app), and happens with transparent [financials](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E). Additionally, proposals.app will soon be established as a non-profit entity, and we pledge never to accept venture capital funding. Until now, proposals.app has only received [a $43,000 USD grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) from Arbitrum DAO via Season 2 of the Domain Allocator grants on Questbook, as well as $6,000 USD for the first-place prize in the Arbitrum GovHack at ETHcc Brussels. No other funding, from any other source, was received, as shown in our [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E).\n\n## 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal through to the end.",

In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.”*\n\nThis proposal will proceed to Tally Thursday 6/5\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n\n* Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n* Added a clear responsibility for the program’s successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n* Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy.\n* Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start.\n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15.\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum’s penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n> * **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.”*\n\nThis proposal will proceed to Tally Thursday 6/5\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n\n* Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n* Added a clear responsibility for the program’s successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n* Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy.\n* Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start.\n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15.\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum’s penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives.

That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026.

              "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time.

Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation.

Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

            "name": "DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)",
            "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n> * **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.”*\n\nThis proposal will proceed to Tally Thursday 6/5\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n\n* Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n* Added a clear responsibility for the program’s successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n* Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy.\n* Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start.\n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15.\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum’s penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n> * **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

            "name": "DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)",
            "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

          "name": "DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)",
          "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

              "body": "# Introduction \n\nThe ArbitrumDAO approved the [OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) which allocates 30M ARB towards an operation company whose mandate is to operationalise, assist and oversee proposals approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe OpCo elections have been completed which appointed Patrick McCorry, A.J. Warner, and Frisson. The three council members have appointed Pedro Breuer as an OAT council member and are in final stage conversations with an identified candidate. All council members, alongside the Arbitrum Foundation, are now working towards operationalizing the OpCo entity and hiring the initial team to lead the organisation.\n\nIn the course of our work we reviewed the original OpCo proposal to fully internalize its mandate and operational capability. We discovered a number of restrictions during this process that may hinder the OpCo’s ability to fulfil its mission, attract the best talent who can contribute towards the OpCo’s success, and prevent the OpCo from proactively working on initiatives that can lead to future proposals in the DAO.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to go through each identified restriction, how it may impact the OpCo’s operational capability, and a proposed fix that can resolve the restrictions.\n\n## Restrictions Identified & Proposed Solutions\n\nWe’ll take this opportunity to go through each restriction alongside the proposed updates for the OpCo. Keep in mind, we will pick the problem statement from the OpCo proposal that most accurately reflects the problem, as sometimes the same restriction is repeated several times in the proposal.\n\n### Inability to Interact with Service Providers\n\n* **Problem:** It’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm).\n\nThe OpCo is unable to enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors unless it is related to its own operational needs.\n\nTo illustrate the issue, let’s consider an example where a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO and the OpCo thinks it may be valuable for the ecosystem. Unfortunately, the OpCo cannot engage with a consulting firm to evaluate the idea. The only option available for OpCo is to encourage the contributor to seek permission (and potential funding from exploratory work) from the DAO.\n\nWe believe this situation is counter to the OpCo’s core mandate to support preliminary work on potentially promising proposals before it reaches the DAO. It should have the freedom to engage third parties, when necessary, to work on initiatives that it believes will receive a positive response from the DAO.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo has the authority to enter contracts with service providers or individual contributors for any matter it deems necessary to fulfil its mandate to support the ArbitrumDAO. The OAT will offer its recommendation to help adjudicate agreements.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to enter agreements with service providers or individual contributors alongside allowing the OAT to provide oversight on whether the agreement indeed fulfils the mandate of supporting the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Restrictive Treasury Spend\n\n* **Problem:** OpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee.\n\nThe OpCo restricts its budget to only be used for operational costs related to employees, running the organisation, and administrative costs.\n\nWe can re-use the previous example to highlight the issue. Let’s assume a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO. The OpCo cannot offer a grant to the contributor to investigate the idea further, in a similar manner to M&A Pilot or the Arbitrum Venture Initiative Pilot. To obtain any exploratory funding, the OpCo will need to work with the contributor on a proposal for the DAO, as opposed to offering its own funds to support preliminary work.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s capital should be reserved to cover the costs of administrative and operational duties as approved by the OAT, but any excess capital that is available can be used on a discretionary basis to fulfil its mandate as a proactive entity in the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to spend funds on a discretionary basis with oversight of the OAT. We believe this is mandatory to ensure the OpCo can be ‘proactive, meaning if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developers could be made, it can propose a strategy’ as written in the original proposal.\n\n### Compensation for OpCo Employees\n\n* **Problem:** 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n\nIn many organisations, it is common for employees to have a base salary, token agreement that vests over time as a structure of the initial compensation package, and a bonus structure for good performance. We believe the bonus pool should be available to support token agreements as well as bonuses.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** 4M ARB allocated to a compensation pool and bonus pool for internal employees and the OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). The compensation pool should be paid out in ARB with a vesting schedule, while the bonus pool shall be denominated in ARB, available for employees only and shall be performance-based. The exact split between the compensation pool and bonus pool shall be determined by the OAT Council.\n\nThis will offer the optionality to offer future employees a token vesting agreement alongside a bonus structure for performance related compensation.\n\n### Restrictions Around Council Elections.\n\n* **Problem:** Any individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-observing seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\nThe initial restrictions were crafted to prevent conflicts of interests for OAT council members, but as we have witnessed in the previous election, several promising candidates who generally have the best interests in Arbitrum in mind were unable to apply and join the OAT. For example, tnorm was unable to apply as it would restrict Gauntlet’s ability to enter service level agreements.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** An individual will be entitled to run as a candidate for the election. No single organisation should be overly represented in the OAT. There should be no more than 1 candidate associated with a single entity. No candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO which include, but not limited to: affiliates with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others. If a candidate is elected on behalf of an organisation, then the OAT membership is tied to them and cannot be rotated to someone else in the organisation. It will be up to the current OAT to enforce the above policy, and if a candidate is excluded from the election, then the rationale must be publicly disclosed to the ArbitrumDAO. If the DAO disagrees, they can initiate a vote with a non-constitutional quorum to overturn the OAT’s decision to exclude a candidate.\n\nThe proposed fix is inspired by the eligibility policy that is applied to Arbitrum’s Security Council as outlined in the ArbitrumDAO’s constitution. It relies on the current OAT to enforce the policy, but if the ArbitrumDAO disagrees with the decision, they can overturn with a vote that achieves a non-constitutional quorum.\n\nOAT members are no longer required to relinquish their role as contributors within the ArbitrumDAO and are allowed to be a member of other DAO-adjacent entity oversight committees. The motivation is to ensure talented individuals can continue to support initiatives in the ArbitrumDAO while offering their expertise to help the OAT navigate its own future. Of course, a contributor may voluntarily decide to relinquish some roles depending on time commitments, to ensure they can dedicate themselves to this role.\n\nFinally, if an OAT member is affiliated with an entity, that entity is no longer prevented from engaging in service provider contracts with the OpCo. Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum’s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo’s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO’s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.",

            "body": "# Introduction \n\nThe ArbitrumDAO approved the [OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) which allocates 30M ARB towards an operation company whose mandate is to operationalise, assist and oversee proposals approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe OpCo elections have been completed which appointed Patrick McCorry, A.J. Warner, and Frisson. The three council members have appointed Pedro Breuer as an OAT council member and are in final stage conversations with an identified candidate. All council members, alongside the Arbitrum Foundation, are now working towards operationalizing the OpCo entity and hiring the initial team to lead the organisation.\n\nIn the course of our work we reviewed the original OpCo proposal to fully internalize its mandate and operational capability. We discovered a number of restrictions during this process that may hinder the OpCo’s ability to fulfil its mission, attract the best talent who can contribute towards the OpCo’s success, and prevent the OpCo from proactively working on initiatives that can lead to future proposals in the DAO.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to go through each identified restriction, how it may impact the OpCo’s operational capability, and a proposed fix that can resolve the restrictions.\n\n## Restrictions Identified & Proposed Solutions\n\nWe’ll take this opportunity to go through each restriction alongside the proposed updates for the OpCo. Keep in mind, we will pick the problem statement from the OpCo proposal that most accurately reflects the problem, as sometimes the same restriction is repeated several times in the proposal.\n\n### Inability to Interact with Service Providers\n\n* **Problem:** It’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm).\n\nThe OpCo is unable to enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors unless it is related to its own operational needs.\n\nTo illustrate the issue, let’s consider an example where a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO and the OpCo thinks it may be valuable for the ecosystem. Unfortunately, the OpCo cannot engage with a consulting firm to evaluate the idea. The only option available for OpCo is to encourage the contributor to seek permission (and potential funding from exploratory work) from the DAO.\n\nWe believe this situation is counter to the OpCo’s core mandate to support preliminary work on potentially promising proposals before it reaches the DAO. It should have the freedom to engage third parties, when necessary, to work on initiatives that it believes will receive a positive response from the DAO.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo has the authority to enter contracts with service providers or individual contributors for any matter it deems necessary to fulfil its mandate to support the ArbitrumDAO. The OAT will offer its recommendation to help adjudicate agreements.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to enter agreements with service providers or individual contributors alongside allowing the OAT to provide oversight on whether the agreement indeed fulfils the mandate of supporting the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Restrictive Treasury Spend\n\n* **Problem:** OpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee.\n\nThe OpCo restricts its budget to only be used for operational costs related to employees, running the organisation, and administrative costs.\n\nWe can re-use the previous example to highlight the issue. Let’s assume a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO. The OpCo cannot offer a grant to the contributor to investigate the idea further, in a similar manner to M&A Pilot or the Arbitrum Venture Initiative Pilot. To obtain any exploratory funding, the OpCo will need to work with the contributor on a proposal for the DAO, as opposed to offering its own funds to support preliminary work.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s capital should be reserved to cover the costs of administrative and operational duties as approved by the OAT, but any excess capital that is available can be used on a discretionary basis to fulfil its mandate as a proactive entity in the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to spend funds on a discretionary basis with oversight of the OAT. We believe this is mandatory to ensure the OpCo can be ‘proactive, meaning if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developers could be made, it can propose a strategy’ as written in the original proposal.\n\n### Compensation for OpCo Employees\n\n* **Problem:** 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n\nIn many organisations, it is common for employees to have a base salary, token agreement that vests over time as a structure of the initial compensation package, and a bonus structure for good performance. We believe the bonus pool should be available to support token agreements as well as bonuses.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** 4M ARB allocated to a compensation pool and bonus pool for internal employees and the OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). The compensation pool should be paid out in ARB with a vesting schedule, while the bonus pool shall be denominated in ARB, available for employees only and shall be performance-based. The exact split between the compensation pool and bonus pool shall be determined by the OAT Council.\n\nThis will offer the optionality to offer future employees a token vesting agreement alongside a bonus structure for performance related compensation.\n\n### Restrictions Around Council Elections.\n\n* **Problem:** Any individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-observing seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\nThe initial restrictions were crafted to prevent conflicts of interests for OAT council members, but as we have witnessed in the previous election, several promising candidates who generally have the best interests in Arbitrum in mind were unable to apply and join the OAT. For example, tnorm was unable to apply as it would restrict Gauntlet’s ability to enter service level agreements.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** An individual will be entitled to run as a candidate for the election. No single organisation should be overly represented in the OAT. There should be no more than 1 candidate associated with a single entity. No candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO which include, but not limited to: affiliates with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others. If a candidate is elected on behalf of an organisation, then the OAT membership is tied to them and cannot be rotated to someone else in the organisation. It will be up to the current OAT to enforce the above policy, and if a candidate is excluded from the election, then the rationale must be publicly disclosed to the ArbitrumDAO. If the DAO disagrees, they can initiate a vote with a non-constitutional quorum to overturn the OAT’s decision to exclude a candidate.\n\nThe proposed fix is inspired by the eligibility policy that is applied to Arbitrum’s Security Council as outlined in the ArbitrumDAO’s constitution. It relies on the current OAT to enforce the policy, but if the ArbitrumDAO disagrees with the decision, they can overturn with a vote that achieves a non-constitutional quorum.\n\nOAT members are no longer required to relinquish their role as contributors within the ArbitrumDAO and are allowed to be a member of other DAO-adjacent entity oversight committees. The motivation is to ensure talented individuals can continue to support initiatives in the ArbitrumDAO while offering their expertise to help the OAT navigate its own future. Of course, a contributor may voluntarily decide to relinquish some roles depending on time commitments, to ensure they can dedicate themselves to this role.\n\nFinally, if an OAT member is affiliated with an entity, that entity is no longer prevented from engaging in service provider contracts with the OpCo. Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum’s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo’s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO’s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.",

Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum’s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo’s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO’s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.",

          "name": "Updating the OpCo Foundation’s Operational Capability",
          "body": "# Introduction \n\nThe ArbitrumDAO approved the [OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) which allocates 30M ARB towards an operation company whose mandate is to operationalise, assist and oversee proposals approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe OpCo elections have been completed which appointed Patrick McCorry, A.J. Warner, and Frisson. The three council members have appointed Pedro Breuer as an OAT council member and are in final stage conversations with an identified candidate. All council members, alongside the Arbitrum Foundation, are now working towards operationalizing the OpCo entity and hiring the initial team to lead the organisation.\n\nIn the course of our work we reviewed the original OpCo proposal to fully internalize its mandate and operational capability. We discovered a number of restrictions during this process that may hinder the OpCo’s ability to fulfil its mission, attract the best talent who can contribute towards the OpCo’s success, and prevent the OpCo from proactively working on initiatives that can lead to future proposals in the DAO.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to go through each identified restriction, how it may impact the OpCo’s operational capability, and a proposed fix that can resolve the restrictions.\n\n## Restrictions Identified & Proposed Solutions\n\nWe’ll take this opportunity to go through each restriction alongside the proposed updates for the OpCo. Keep in mind, we will pick the problem statement from the OpCo proposal that most accurately reflects the problem, as sometimes the same restriction is repeated several times in the proposal.\n\n### Inability to Interact with Service Providers\n\n* **Problem:** It’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm).\n\nThe OpCo is unable to enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors unless it is related to its own operational needs.\n\nTo illustrate the issue, let’s consider an example where a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO and the OpCo thinks it may be valuable for the ecosystem. Unfortunately, the OpCo cannot engage with a consulting firm to evaluate the idea. The only option available for OpCo is to encourage the contributor to seek permission (and potential funding from exploratory work) from the DAO.\n\nWe believe this situation is counter to the OpCo’s core mandate to support preliminary work on potentially promising proposals before it reaches the DAO. It should have the freedom to engage third parties, when necessary, to work on initiatives that it believes will receive a positive response from the DAO.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo has the authority to enter contracts with service providers or individual contributors for any matter it deems necessary to fulfil its mandate to support the ArbitrumDAO. The OAT will offer its recommendation to help adjudicate agreements.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to enter agreements with service providers or individual contributors alongside allowing the OAT to provide oversight on whether the agreement indeed fulfils the mandate of supporting the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Restrictive Treasury Spend\n\n* **Problem:** OpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee.\n\nThe OpCo restricts its budget to only be used for operational costs related to employees, running the organisation, and administrative costs.\n\nWe can re-use the previous example to highlight the issue. Let’s assume a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO. The OpCo cannot offer a grant to the contributor to investigate the idea further, in a similar manner to M&A Pilot or the Arbitrum Venture Initiative Pilot. To obtain any exploratory funding, the OpCo will need to work with the contributor on a proposal for the DAO, as opposed to offering its own funds to support preliminary work.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s capital should be reserved to cover the costs of administrative and operational duties as approved by the OAT, but any excess capital that is available can be used on a discretionary basis to fulfil its mandate as a proactive entity in the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to spend funds on a discretionary basis with oversight of the OAT. We believe this is mandatory to ensure the OpCo can be ‘proactive, meaning if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developers could be made, it can propose a strategy’ as written in the original proposal.\n\n### Compensation for OpCo Employees\n\n* **Problem:** 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n\nIn many organisations, it is common for employees to have a base salary, token agreement that vests over time as a structure of the initial compensation package, and a bonus structure for good performance. We believe the bonus pool should be available to support token agreements as well as bonuses.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** 4M ARB allocated to a compensation pool and bonus pool for internal employees and the OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). The compensation pool should be paid out in ARB with a vesting schedule, while the bonus pool shall be denominated in ARB, available for employees only and shall be performance-based. The exact split between the compensation pool and bonus pool shall be determined by the OAT Council.\n\nThis will offer the optionality to offer future employees a token vesting agreement alongside a bonus structure for performance related compensation.\n\n### Restrictions Around Council Elections.\n\n* **Problem:** Any individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-observing seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\nThe initial restrictions were crafted to prevent conflicts of interests for OAT council members, but as we have witnessed in the previous election, several promising candidates who generally have the best interests in Arbitrum in mind were unable to apply and join the OAT. For example, tnorm was unable to apply as it would restrict Gauntlet’s ability to enter service level agreements.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** An individual will be entitled to run as a candidate for the election. No single organisation should be overly represented in the OAT. There should be no more than 1 candidate associated with a single entity. No candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO which include, but not limited to: affiliates with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others. If a candidate is elected on behalf of an organisation, then the OAT membership is tied to them and cannot be rotated to someone else in the organisation. It will be up to the current OAT to enforce the above policy, and if a candidate is excluded from the election, then the rationale must be publicly disclosed to the ArbitrumDAO. If the DAO disagrees, they can initiate a vote with a non-constitutional quorum to overturn the OAT’s decision to exclude a candidate.\n\nThe proposed fix is inspired by the eligibility policy that is applied to Arbitrum’s Security Council as outlined in the ArbitrumDAO’s constitution. It relies on the current OAT to enforce the policy, but if the ArbitrumDAO disagrees with the decision, they can overturn with a vote that achieves a non-constitutional quorum.\n\nOAT members are no longer required to relinquish their role as contributors within the ArbitrumDAO and are allowed to be a member of other DAO-adjacent entity oversight committees. The motivation is to ensure talented individuals can continue to support initiatives in the ArbitrumDAO while offering their expertise to help the OAT navigate its own future. Of course, a contributor may voluntarily decide to relinquish some roles depending on time commitments, to ensure they can dedicate themselves to this role.\n\nFinally, if an OAT member is affiliated with an entity, that entity is no longer prevented from engaging in service provider contracts with the OpCo. Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum’s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo’s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO’s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.",

              "body": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router\n### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings ([https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi/)). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings ([https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/)), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at [https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/))\n\n* USDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F)\n* sUSDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793)\n* Official USDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b)\n* Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610)\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity\\_MakerDAO\\_Arbitrum\\_Token\\_Bridge\\_audit.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf)\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora)\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n\\[1] [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208)\n\n\\[2] [https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef)\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n\\[1] [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208)\n\n\\[2] [https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef)\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal.

Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits. While this document isn’t gateway-specific, you can view the Sky Atlas Emergency Response System, maintained by Powerhouse, here:\nhttps://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.8_Emergency_Response_System/a1c2d773-f5f9-4e17-9da4-edd82ea4140b%7C0db3\n\n\n\n### Deployment Details\n\nWe propose the execution of the setGateways method [1] on the L1GatewayRouter contract [2] on Ethereum for both USDS and sUSDS tokens. This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n[1] https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

            "name": "[CONSTITUTIONAL] Proposal: For Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router",
            "body": "### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings (https://spark.fi). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings (https://app.spark.fi/), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits. While this document isn’t gateway-specific, you can view the Sky Atlas Emergency Response System, maintained by Powerhouse, here:\nhttps://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.8_Emergency_Response_System/a1c2d773-f5f9-4e17-9da4-edd82ea4140b%7C0db3\n\n\n\n### Deployment Details\n\nWe propose the execution of the setGateways method [1] on the L1GatewayRouter contract [2] on Ethereum for both USDS and sUSDS tokens. This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n[1] https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

            "body": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router\n### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings ([https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi/)). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings ([https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/)), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at [https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/))\n\n* USDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F)\n* sUSDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793)\n* Official USDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b)\n* Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610)\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity\\_MakerDAO\\_Arbitrum\\_Token\\_Bridge\\_audit.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf)\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora)\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n\\[1] [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208)\n\n\\[2] [https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef)\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits. While this document isn’t gateway-specific, you can view the Sky Atlas Emergency Response System, maintained by Powerhouse, here:\nhttps://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.8_Emergency_Response_System/a1c2d773-f5f9-4e17-9da4-edd82ea4140b%7C0db3\n\n\n\n### Deployment Details\n\nWe propose the execution of the setGateways method [1] on the L1GatewayRouter contract [2] on Ethereum for both USDS and sUSDS tokens. This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n[1] https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

          "name": "[CONSTITUTIONAL] Proposal: For Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router",
          "body": "### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings (https://spark.fi). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings (https://app.spark.fi/), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits. While this document isn’t gateway-specific, you can view the Sky Atlas Emergency Response System, maintained by Powerhouse, here:\nhttps://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.8_Emergency_Response_System/a1c2d773-f5f9-4e17-9da4-edd82ea4140b%7C0db3\n\n\n\n### Deployment Details\n\nWe propose the execution of the setGateways method [1] on the L1GatewayRouter contract [2] on Ethereum for both USDS and sUSDS tokens. This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n[1] https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.”*\n\nThis proposal will proceed to Tally Thursday 6/5\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n\n* Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n* Added a clear responsibility for the program’s successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n* Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy.\n* Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start.\n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15.\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum’s penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n> * **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4.

In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.”*\n\nThis proposal will proceed to Tally Thursday 6/5\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n\n* Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n* Added a clear responsibility for the program’s successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n* Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy.\n* Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start.\n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15.\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum’s penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n> * **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

              "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience.

The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

            "name": "DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)",
            "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.”*\n\nThis proposal will proceed to Tally Thursday 6/5\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n\n* Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n* Added a clear responsibility for the program’s successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n* Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy.\n* Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start.\n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15.\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum’s penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n> * **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n> * **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/chaoslabs/48/11894_2.png\" />[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables) | Insights & Key Findings](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515/1)\n\n> * **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/7)\n\n> To summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> * Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://yyz1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/user_avatar/forum.arbitrum.foundation/blockworksresearch/48/1093_2.png\" />[ARDC Research Deliverables](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14)\n\n> TVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> established protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e9c0ed/48.png\" />[ARB's Wake-Up Call: A Critical Pivot is Necessary](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706/1)\n\n> The proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program.\n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. The DAO will have the ability to kill the DRIP program via a snapshot vote with 3% quorum and more votes for than against. In the scenario that the DAO ends the DRIP program via vote, the Arbitrum Foundation will do their best to send all unallocated funds back to the DAO in a timely manner, however, if there is an ongoing season, it’s possible that the season may be seen through before the program is ended.\n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\n\nSnapshot: May 15\n\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates.\n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

            "name": "DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)",
            "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

          "name": "DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP)",
          "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n### Changes on 5/12/25\n- Added specification that funds will be sent to a foundation-controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities\n- Added a clear responsibility for the program's successes/failures to Entropy, even with the committee structure\n- Added additional details surrounding community input, more specification that builders and procurement experts will be called on to give input through Entropy. \n- Added flexibility around timeline in place of targeting July 1 start. \n\nThis proposal will be going to Snapshot this Thursday, 5/15. \n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEntropy proposes a new type of incentives framework focused on targeting specific assets and activities across Arbitrum rather than specific protocols. Incentives per specific assets/activities will run in 3-month seasons through the DRIP so that the program can be adapted and different assets and activities can be selected as learnings are taken into account. Each season must have a singular, specified goal. For example, Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT against wstETH or Ensure Arbitrum One Has the deepest liquidity for trading USDT/ETH.\n\nA season selection committee made up of the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and Offchain Labs will be tasked with creating eligible, viable seasons with ideation input from partner companies and key stakeholders. The committee will maintain the right to modify, extend, or discontinue a season during its lifecycle. The “3-month” timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and is open to change dependent on perceived program success and market conditions.\n\nThe DRIP seeks funding of 80M ARB for the first 4 seasons, with a maximum of 20M allocated per season and a portion set aside for operational costs related to vendors utilized by the season selection committee. The season selection committee will procure partners for distribution and evaluation at their discretion, and potentially other partners as it sees fit. For example, the distribution partner will check the chain for wallet eligibility and distribute rewards to the wallets that have met the mandated goals of a season and create a frontend through which all eligible protocols will be shown. The evaluation partner will host open data around the program and recommend optimization improvements to the committee throughout a season’s lifecycle; after a season is complete, the evaluation partner will provide a more holistic analysis to the DAO. The same partners will likely be utilized throughout all 4 seasons. 80M ARB is the maximum amount that can be allocated throughout the 4 initial seasons, but there is no requirement to use all funds. All remaining ARB not used as part of the program will be held for further seasons or returned to the DAO if further seasons are not approved by the end of the 1-year mandate.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nAs the [Incentives Detox](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849?u=entropy) concluded on December 17th, 2024, and with many parties exploring the next phase of incentives, Entropy has decided to take a first-principles approach to redesign the DAO’s incentives framework. After analysis of [Chaos’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-risk-deliverables-insights-key-findings/25515) and [Blockworks’](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-research-deliverables/23438/14) incentives reviews, and in collaboration with Gauntlet and other stakeholders, we have identified that taking the approach of incentivizing specific activities that the DAO would like to increase Arbitrum’s market share in will deliver better results than more generalized programs that are harder to evaluate and adapt. This is especially true for activities where Arbitrum has not yet achieved an established, stable market share or where the underlying vertical will be experiencing a systemic shock.\n\nThe DRIP is purposefully simple, targeted, and measurable, and focuses solely on the goal of bringing popular activity taking place on other ecosystems to Arbitrum One in a sustainable manner. In past programs, by lumping together oracles, perps, lending, dex trading, dex liquidity, bridges, and more, evaluation and iteration became an impossible task. One reason for this is the fact that protocols across different verticals and long-tail vs. core assets inherently cannot be judged on an apples-to-apples basis. The DRIP focuses on a controlled experimentation approach.\n\nLooking across the space at activities that real DeFi users are executing in practice where Arbitrum’s market share shows growth potential either through innovation/potential partnerships on the application layer or through changes to the underlying market, a few ideas come to mind. For example, borrowing against yield-generating ETH a.k.a. “Looping,” creating the deepest liquidity on specific high-attention assets (per [IOSG](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbs-wake-up-call-a-critical-pivot-is-necessary/27706)), bringing a vibrant wrapped BTC ecosystem to the network, increasing Arbitrum’s RWA utility and dominance, or focusing on attracting liquidity to restaking and LRTs. These are just a few examples of activities through which Arbitrum One has substantial room to grow, but the list goes on. We believe that for an incentives program to succeed, even within these targeted activities, target assets need to be selected in order for the program to proceed smoothly. By limiting programs to category-leading assets, or the category’s highest-growth assets, Arbitrum can take an opinionated stance and bet on what areas of growth it envisions as crypto’s most valuable use-cases into the future. Notably, the DRIP focuses on quality activities and assets that the DAO views as high-growth and -retention, rather than attempting to create a program that treats everything equally. The program focuses solely on using incentives as a tool in more holistic strategies around promising verticals where Arbitrum's penetration has room to grow sustainably in its competitive environment.\n\nAnother benefit of the DRIP is its value in business development and growth. Potential Arbitrum partners will see a program that could benefit them if they put a primary focus on Arbitrum. This will allow Arbitrum’s partnership teams, including Entropy Advisors and Offchain Labs, to use the DRIP as an incentive that makes Arbitrum more attractive to protocols exploring alternative/genesis chain deployments. This will create a frictionless path that effectively attracts new Arbitrum entrants while still supporting incumbents.\n\nUpon ARDC analysis of our past incentives programs, a few findings are particularly notable:\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Experiment and Iterate:** Each of the studied protocols did this successfully in their own way. This was the clearest takeaway from the program and incentive programs should be thought of similarly to paid marketing campaigns in web2. The optimal design is constantly evolving and not always obvious purely to reasoning. There is no substitute for controlled experimentation.\n\n* **Keep the Incentive Criteria Clear and Simple:** Users need to know what to do to react optimally to incentives. If the criteria are too complex, education becomes an issue, and attention will go to easier-to-earn incentives. All three protocols made the incentivized activity and payoff extremely clear and easy to understand.\n\n* **Use Incentives to Amplify New Features and Announcements:** This was done by all three protocols studied and significantly impacts bootstrapping new markets, bringing visibility to new features and generally leaning into growth areas.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"chaoslabs, post:1, topic:25515\"]\n\n* **Do Not Interfere with the Natural Balance between Supply and Demand:** Focusing too much on either side of the market can upset the state of equilibrium. This will likely correct once the program ends rendering this allocation of resources sub-optimal. This does not apply when the market under-compensates certain activities and require long-term subsidies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:7, topic:23438\"]\n\nTo summarize, all of the analyzed protocols saw their top-line metrics increase during the STIP, but in the months following the program’s end, figures trended back toward September 2023 values. There was some variability in how much capital/volume each protocol had managed to capture per ARB spent at the end of the STIP, but in the long term, these multiples tended to converge to a tight range. There are a few exceptions to this—protocols that are on the younger side and generally offer differentiated products. These protocols have successfully reached notably higher “steady states” compared to the beginning of the program, with incentives likely amplifying market penetration deriving from intrinsic drivers and on a few occasions, leading to more robust collaboration between the outperformers and other Arbitrum protocols, creating additional synergies.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* For the DEX category, protocols that enhance LP experience (i.e. increase LP returns) outperformed.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\n* Protocols that formed partnerships during LTIPP generally saw better results.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"BlockworksResearch, post:14, topic:23438\"]\n\nTVL is an attractive vanity metric to optimize, the utilization of that capital is what ultimately determines the efficacy and success of lending protocols.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nestablished protocols have disproportionate influence\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"momir_iosg, post:1, topic:27706\"]\n\nThe proposed distribution model shifts ARB token incentives from protocols to liquidity providers directly.\n\n[/quote]\n\nTaking these learnings into account, we believe that the DRIP’s ultra-targeted nature (controlled environment experiment), focused on high-value verticals where Arbitrum has high potential to increase its market penetration, is an ideal path forward as we continue to iterate and evolve over time. DRIP will also take advantage of the learnings to prioritize programs that focus on both supply and the efficacy of that supply through demand. Finally, marketing is a missing aspect from every past program, which the DRIP will address by having the foundation included on the committee and requiring eligible protocols to co-market.\n\nEntropy encourages the whole community to participate in proposing new activities and assets for incentives and is happy to be the primary point of contact for community ideation. There will absolutely be opportunities for community input throughout the DRIP process. Entropy will be actively calling on the community to help ideate (and already have been) on the most impactful season goals and service providers with a particular interest in opinions from those with DeFi and procurement experience. That said, the committee will have full discretion over all aspects of season planning and execution with help from the onboarded distribution & evaluation vendors.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Rules of a DRIP Season\n\n-The seasons must have a defined, singular goal. Specificity is required. As an example, “Increase trading activity”, is not a specific goal, but “create the deepest aggregate liquidity for the USDT/ETH pair across DEXs on Arbitrum One” would qualify as a specific goal.\n\n-Seasons are intended to be ~3 months, though they can be cut short by the committee or extended at their discretion, with the goal of always tapering rewards instead of arbitrarily cutting incentives at once.\n\n-Overlapping seasons running in tandem that may make evaluation more difficult should be avoided.\n\n-Need to be chain-wide and protocol agnostic (minus security-related whitelisting or a TVL/protocol-maturity requirement). Depending on the vertical and ROI after a program starts, the committee can expand or restrict how broad the program is.\n\n-Actionable and executable, including all details required.\n\n-Target asset/activity should maintain room for Arbitrum to grow its market share with a goal of eventually hitting “critical mass,” where incentives are no longer needed.\n\n-Eligible protocols must include marketing in their frontend and on their socials, coordinating co-marketing with Entropy Advisors and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### Distribution Partner\n\nEach incentive “season” is governed by a set of rules specifying which onchain actions or participants qualify for ARB rewards. An independent distribution partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Receiving ARB for the Season\n2. Identifying Eligible Wallets: The partner reviews network data to find wallets that meet the season’s eligibility criteria.\n3. Distributing ARB Rewards: Once the partner confirms which wallets qualify, it distributes the ARB to each eligible wallet based on the season’s defined, and potentially changing, parameters. No distribution is sent directly to protocols; all ARB flows to qualifying wallets.\n4. Frontend Creation: Shows all eligible protocols, effective APRs, and data from the evaluation partner.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\n\nIf a season incentivizes borrowing USDT against wstETH, applying to all lending markets with >$X million TVL, the evaluation partner would examine eligible lending protocols on Arbitrum, identify the addresses meeting the criteria (e.g., required collateral ratio, borrowing amounts, etc.), and distribute ARB rewards to those addresses.\n\nExamples of potential partners include RoyCo, Boost, Galxe, Brevis, Merkl, and others. All costs associated with this partner will be taken from the 80M ARB budget, but the season selection committee prioritizes keeping low OpEx, as the point of the program is user rewards. Although, we will note that our opinion is that previous incentive programs run by the DAO could have been notably more effective had more resources been allocated to the programs’ operations.\n\n**Selection Process:**\n\nThe season selection committee will have full discretion on how the procurement is run; public or private application and evaluation, open or invitation only, who is selected, etc. The process will be fully facilitated by the season selection committee, and the decision of the partner will be fully at their discretion.\n\n### Evaluation Partner\n\nEach incentive program requires ongoing monitoring and analysis to assess its impact and guide continuous improvements. An independent evaluation partner is responsible for:\n\n1. Providing Continuous Public Data: The partner hosts a publicly accessible data dashboard that tracks relevant metrics throughout the program, such as DEX volumes, total incentives distributed, user participation rates, and more.\n2. Program Assessment & Recommendations: The partner periodically reviews program performance, compiling findings into reports, and recommends changes to, e.g., return levels of incentivised actions and eligibility criteria during each season. After each season, they additionally provide recommendations on how the program could be improved. Analysis should include retention metrics in the following 2-3 months as well.\n\nEntropy will take this role into our domain as well, but we believe having an additional outside party will be beneficial.\n\n**Illustrative Example**\nIf a program incentivizes liquidity provision on DEXs with over $10 million TVL, the evaluation partner would track how many and what types of wallets participated, the total ARB distributed, changes in TVL and capital efficiency, overall volume growth, cost of capital for similar opportunities in other ecosystems, returns to users that are performing the incentivized action, retention after the program’s end, etc. The partner would then share these insights and recommend any adjustments (e.g., refining eligibility criteria, adjusting reward distribution thresholds) to the season selection committee. Holistic recommendations will be given publicly at the end of the program cycle.\n\nThe same selection process will take place for the evaluation partner as distribution. The same provider can apply for both evaluation and distribution.\n\n### Condensed Example of a Season:\n\n**Goal: Make Arbitrum One the best place to borrow USDT, USDC, and ETH against wstETH.**\n\n**Select Collateral**: wstETH\n\n**Select Borrowable assets**: ETH, USDC, and USDT\n\n**Required LTV**: 15%\n\n**Target yield boost for wstETH**: 2% APR (increase over wstETH base yield)\n\n**Maximum collateral incentivized**: $1B\n\nProtocol Partner RFP: The program will be platform/protocol agnostic and target lending across Arbitrum One. With that said, protocols will be screened for security purposes before being included in the program. The thought process behind this decision surrounds not incentivizing (or appearing to endorse) Arbitrum’s users to deposit assets into protocols that have a higher likelihood of being hacked. The security provider selected in the ARDC will be in charge of whitelisting lending protocols or alternatively the committee enlists a firm that can do this. The lending platform partners must support wstETH as collateral and borrowing of USDC, USDT, or ETH against that collateral in order to be eligible. This creates a fair environment that should not negatively encumber any specific lending market.\n\nIn practice, this means that any borrower of USDC, USDT, and/or ETH on a whitelisted Arbitrum One-based lending platform will be eligible to receive 2% APR paid on the total value of their wstETH deposited into the lending protocol. Wallets will only be eligible if they have reached and sustained an LTV of 15%. Rewards will be paid out weekly by a distribution partner.\n\nWith a 3-month program, targeting a 2% yield, $5M will cover 3 months of runway on $1B in collateral participating in the program.\n\n## Season Selection Committee\n\n1. Arbitrum Foundation\n2. Entropy Advisors\n3. Offchain Labs\n\n⅔ votes are required for a season to be approved. The first 4 seasons that meet the rule requirements and are deemed valid by the committee will be enacted. We realize that accountability in committees has been a problem in the past and we would like to make clear that Entropy should be held as the part responsible for the successes and failures of the program. \n\nAll funds will be sent to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet with DAO-clawback capabilities. \n\nThe committee also has the power to:\n\n1. Kill the Program: If the program fails to perform, at the discretion of the committee, it reserves the right to terminate it.\n2. Adjust the Program: Reward allocations or program parameters may be modified, guided by insights from the evaluation partner. All adjustments must remain within the scope of the original proposal, balancing agility with accountability to ensure the program continues to serve its intended goals.\n3. Widen or constrict the apps eligible in a season\n4. Any other changes: The season selection committee will be able to make any changes to the program as they see fit as long as it maintains the spirit of the DRIP proposal\n\n## Rough Timeline\n\nForum: April 16\nSnapshot: May 15\nTally: May X (TBD)\n\nDate For First Program Live: Targeting July, but would like to remain nimble given that potential partnerships may impact go-live dates. \n\nDRIP End Date (funds returned if not used or another proposal is not passed): July 1, 2026. An ongoing season may go past this date, but new seasons will not begin after this date",

              "body": "# Let’s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations\n\n## Abstract\n\n[proposals.app](https://proposals.app) proposes a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO to enhance the usability of this governance forum, so that delegates, tokenholders, and forum readers can have more context and information about our DAO proposals. We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of one year, for a total of **$60,000 USD**.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently, DAO governance remains a disjointed, messy, and confusing experience for delegates and tokenholders.** We believe that one of the main reasons for this is the clear lack of foundational DAO tooling that prioritizes true composability and aggregates data from multiple (even competing) offchain and onchain sources, thereby providing a more comprehensive and enjoyable user experience for DAO delegates and tokenholders. We believe that to achieve this, DAO tools should be free and open-source, operate under a non-profit entity that ideally has public financial records of its operations. At proposals.app, we strive to uphold these beliefs.\n\n[Andrei](https://andreiv.com) and I have been building DAO tools since mid-2023, starting with [Senate](https://x.com/SenateLabs), where we previously piloted two forum integrations (one with [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044), and another with [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680)), and more recently, we’ve been working on [proposals.app](https://x.com/proposalsapp), where we’ve developed dedicated tooling for Arbitrum DAO’s governance needs that was funded through [a questbook grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) last October. More specifically, we’ve designed and developed a [unified governance aggregator](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-proposals-app-govhack-brussels-winner/25370) that brings together, under the same platform, the discourse forum comments and both offchain and onchain votes, so that delegates can access the complete history of every proposal in Arbitrum DAO. We launched it publicly on April 5ᵗʰ at ETH Bucharest 2025, and you can check it out at [arbitrum.proposals.app](https://arbitrum.proposals.app) and share your thoughts about it with us in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/+U9QrY4L8wfNiMzA8).\n\nWe’re now proposing **a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO** to bring some of the exclusive proposals.app features we have in our app, to this governance forum. **We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum**, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of 12 months.\n\n![Demo of the three proposals.app feature integrations](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7e148a110ffeb8388f8bccdee73242f41437c45d.gif)\n\nWe believe that **these three features will enhance usability and accessibility** in this governance forum for all users, regardless of their level of maturity.\n\nThese three features, as demonstrated above, are:\n\n1. **Live Votes** – Show the live or latest vote at the top of the page for each forum topic in the proposals category\n2. **Voting Power Tags** – Show the voting power of each delegate, under their username, for every comment on the forum\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – Provide a way for forum visitors to subscribe to email notifications, receiving an email every time a new discussion is started, when an offchain or onchain vote begins, and when its voting period is nearing completion.\n\nWith these three proposals.app feature integrations in this forum, we believe will see **bigger governance participation and better engagement in discussions**, from a more diverse set of delegates and tokenholders, who will have more context about who is commenting on what, about when proposals are up to a vote and where and when to vote in each moment of the proposal lifecycle.\n\nWe shared a short demo of proposals.app and these three proposed feature integrations on the [Open Governance Call on June 3rd](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/june-3-2025-open-discussion-of-proposals-governance-call/29377?u=paulofonseca), and you can see the recording of that demo and presentation, as well as some Q&A, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MToHsWqQxs).\n\n## Rationale\n\nConstantly improving and caring for the governance processes in Arbitrum DAO is essential to maintain a healthy, engaged, resilient, and decentralized DAO. In Arbitrum DAO’s case, where tokenholders and delegates actually have on-chain control over protocol upgrades and treasury spending, it becomes even more critical that **they vote with as much context and information as possible in each and every vote.**\n\nAdditionally, **in token-weighted voting DAOs, not all voices carry the same weight.** Powerful delegates commenting and giving feedback on proposals are crucial signals of support. On the other hand, newly created forum accounts with no voting power, which are becoming more prevalent in the age of AI, make way more noise than signal and disrupt the discussion flow. Proposers and readers should be able to distinguish between the two and everything in between, much more easily.\n\nAs stated in [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), we should strive to follow our stated Community Values, and specifically:\n\n> **Neutral and open:** Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.\n\nWe believe it’s essential for Arbitrum DAO to have multiple governance platforms available to its tokenholders, delegates, and voters, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them with tools that suit their particular needs and help them engage in governance in an easier and clearer way.\n\nWe also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. Regarding the obvious matter of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue participating in governance permissionlessly. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) [is fully open source](https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp) and will continue to be. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** – Showing discourse users’ voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token** and **maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets** on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** – In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot’s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a “Setup Proposal Notifications” button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the **Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the **Proposal Notification Emails** integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**. After a successful offchain vote, we will move this proposal and publish an **onchain vote on Monday, June 23rd**, to start the voting period on Thursday, June 26th.\n\n===\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, we can kick off this work and start the timeline proposed above, **as early as July 15th.**\n\n===\n\nThis would mean that we could deliver all of the proposed scope, 1 month later, **on August 15th**.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nWe propose to build, maintain, and host these three feature integrations for Arbitrum for a minimum of 12 months. The total cost to the Arbitrum DAO, is **$60,000 USD**.\n\nHere is the cost breakdown:\n\n| Item | Amount |\n| ------------------- | ------: |\n| **Maintenance** 1 year (1 day of Design + 1 day of Development + 1 day of Testing, per month) | $48,000 USD |\n| **Hosting** 1 year (3 Servers, DNS, and Emails) | $12,000 USD |\n| **Total** | **$60,000 USD** |\n\nThe **Maintenance** fee includes 1 day per month of Design, 1 day per month of Development, and 1 day per month of Testing, to ensure we maintain these features with an up-to-date user experience and quality of service, and that we can incorporate the delegates’ future feedback on these proposals.app feature integrations.\n\nThe **Hosting** fee includes the monthly costs for all the infrastructure we use, which can be live-monitored on [status.proposals.app](https://status.proposals.app/).\n\nWe propose that the payment be done as a one-time payment of $60,000 USD.\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, the funds should be transferred either to **the MSS or the Arbitrum Foundation** (depending on the outcome of the current [Wind Down the MSS](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wind-down-the-mss-transfer-payment-responsibilities-to-the-arbitrum-foundation/29279) proposal), which would certify the delivery of the three feature integrations and release the payment after a successful deployment.\n\n## Pledge\n\nAndrei and Paulo pledge to continually work towards a future where DAO governance tools are genuinely credibly neutral. Therefore, our work is [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErD4sHs2Zk&list=PLaYDaaHm0oQGefGFDg8dt77ce7MQaUghG), fully [open-source](https://github.com/proposals-app), and happens with transparent [financials](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E). Additionally, proposals.app will soon be established as a non-profit entity, and we pledge never to accept venture capital funding. Until now, proposals.app has only received [a $43,000 USD grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) from Arbitrum DAO via Season 2 of the Domain Allocator grants on Questbook, as well as $6,000 USD for the first-place prize in the Arbitrum GovHack at ETHcc Brussels. No other funding, from any other source, was received, as shown in our [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E).\n\n## 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal through to the end.",

            "body": "# Let’s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations\n\n## Abstract\n\n[proposals.app](https://proposals.app) proposes a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO to enhance the usability of this governance forum, so that delegates, tokenholders, and forum readers can have more context and information about our DAO proposals. We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of one year, for a total of **$60,000 USD**.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently, DAO governance remains a disjointed, messy, and confusing experience for delegates and tokenholders.** We believe that one of the main reasons for this is the clear lack of foundational DAO tooling that prioritizes true composability and aggregates data from multiple (even competing) offchain and onchain sources, thereby providing a more comprehensive and enjoyable user experience for DAO delegates and tokenholders. We believe that to achieve this, DAO tools should be free and open-source, operate under a non-profit entity that ideally has public financial records of its operations. At proposals.app, we strive to uphold these beliefs.\n\n[Andrei](https://andreiv.com) and I have been building DAO tools since mid-2023, starting with [Senate](https://x.com/SenateLabs), where we previously piloted two forum integrations (one with [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044), and another with [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680)), and more recently, we’ve been working on [proposals.app](https://x.com/proposalsapp), where we’ve developed dedicated tooling for Arbitrum DAO’s governance needs that was funded through [a questbook grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) last October. More specifically, we’ve designed and developed a [unified governance aggregator](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-proposals-app-govhack-brussels-winner/25370) that brings together, under the same platform, the discourse forum comments and both offchain and onchain votes, so that delegates can access the complete history of every proposal in Arbitrum DAO. We launched it publicly on April 5ᵗʰ at ETH Bucharest 2025, and you can check it out at [arbitrum.proposals.app](https://arbitrum.proposals.app) and share your thoughts about it with us in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/+U9QrY4L8wfNiMzA8).\n\nWe’re now proposing **a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO** to bring some of the exclusive proposals.app features we have in our app, to this governance forum. **We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum**, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of 12 months.\n\n![Demo of the three proposals.app feature integrations](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7e148a110ffeb8388f8bccdee73242f41437c45d.gif)\n\nWe believe that **these three features will enhance usability and accessibility** in this governance forum for all users, regardless of their level of maturity.\n\nThese three features, as demonstrated above, are:\n\n1. **Live Votes** – Show the live or latest vote at the top of the page for each forum topic in the proposals category\n2. **Voting Power Tags** – Show the voting power of each delegate, under their username, for every comment on the forum\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – Provide a way for forum visitors to subscribe to email notifications, receiving an email every time a new discussion is started, when an offchain or onchain vote begins, and when its voting period is nearing completion.\n\nWith these three proposals.app feature integrations in this forum, we believe will see **bigger governance participation and better engagement in discussions**, from a more diverse set of delegates and tokenholders, who will have more context about who is commenting on what, about when proposals are up to a vote and where and when to vote in each moment of the proposal lifecycle.\n\nWe shared a short demo of proposals.app and these three proposed feature integrations on the [Open Governance Call on June 3rd](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/june-3-2025-open-discussion-of-proposals-governance-call/29377?u=paulofonseca), and you can see the recording of that demo and presentation, as well as some Q&A, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MToHsWqQxs).\n\n## Rationale\n\nConstantly improving and caring for the governance processes in Arbitrum DAO is essential to maintain a healthy, engaged, resilient, and decentralized DAO. In Arbitrum DAO’s case, where tokenholders and delegates actually have on-chain control over protocol upgrades and treasury spending, it becomes even more critical that **they vote with as much context and information as possible in each and every vote.**\n\nAdditionally, **in token-weighted voting DAOs, not all voices carry the same weight.** Powerful delegates commenting and giving feedback on proposals are crucial signals of support. On the other hand, newly created forum accounts with no voting power, which are becoming more prevalent in the age of AI, make way more noise than signal and disrupt the discussion flow. Proposers and readers should be able to distinguish between the two and everything in between, much more easily.\n\nAs stated in [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), we should strive to follow our stated Community Values, and specifically:\n\n> **Neutral and open:** Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.\n\nWe believe it’s essential for Arbitrum DAO to have multiple governance platforms available to its tokenholders, delegates, and voters, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them with tools that suit their particular needs and help them engage in governance in an easier and clearer way.\n\nWe also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. Regarding the obvious matter of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue participating in governance permissionlessly. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) [is fully open source](https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp) and will continue to be. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** – Showing discourse users’ voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token** and **maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets** on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** – In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot’s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a “Setup Proposal Notifications” button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the **Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the **Proposal Notification Emails** integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**. After a successful offchain vote, we will move this proposal and publish an **onchain vote on Monday, June 23rd**, to start the voting period on Thursday, June 26th.\n\n===\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, we can kick off this work and start the timeline proposed above, **as early as July 15th.**\n\n===\n\nThis would mean that we could deliver all of the proposed scope, 1 month later, **on August 15th**.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nWe propose to build, maintain, and host these three feature integrations for Arbitrum for a minimum of 12 months. The total cost to the Arbitrum DAO, is **$60,000 USD**.\n\nHere is the cost breakdown:\n\n| Item | Amount |\n| ------------------- | ------: |\n| **Maintenance** 1 year (1 day of Design + 1 day of Development + 1 day of Testing, per month) | $48,000 USD |\n| **Hosting** 1 year (3 Servers, DNS, and Emails) | $12,000 USD |\n| **Total** | **$60,000 USD** |\n\nThe **Maintenance** fee includes 1 day per month of Design, 1 day per month of Development, and 1 day per month of Testing, to ensure we maintain these features with an up-to-date user experience and quality of service, and that we can incorporate the delegates’ future feedback on these proposals.app feature integrations.\n\nThe **Hosting** fee includes the monthly costs for all the infrastructure we use, which can be live-monitored on [status.proposals.app](https://status.proposals.app/).\n\nWe propose that the payment be done as a one-time payment of $60,000 USD.\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, the funds should be transferred either to **the MSS or the Arbitrum Foundation** (depending on the outcome of the current [Wind Down the MSS](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wind-down-the-mss-transfer-payment-responsibilities-to-the-arbitrum-foundation/29279) proposal), which would certify the delivery of the three feature integrations and release the payment after a successful deployment.\n\n## Pledge\n\nAndrei and Paulo pledge to continually work towards a future where DAO governance tools are genuinely credibly neutral. Therefore, our work is [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErD4sHs2Zk&list=PLaYDaaHm0oQGefGFDg8dt77ce7MQaUghG), fully [open-source](https://github.com/proposals-app), and happens with transparent [financials](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E). Additionally, proposals.app will soon be established as a non-profit entity, and we pledge never to accept venture capital funding. Until now, proposals.app has only received [a $43,000 USD grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) from Arbitrum DAO via Season 2 of the Domain Allocator grants on Questbook, as well as $6,000 USD for the first-place prize in the Arbitrum GovHack at ETHcc Brussels. No other funding, from any other source, was received, as shown in our [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E).\n\n## 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal through to the end.",

            "body": "# Let’s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations\n\n## Abstract\n\n[proposals.app](https://proposals.app) proposes a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO to enhance the usability of this governance forum, so that delegates, tokenholders, and forum readers can have more context and information about our DAO proposals. We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of one year, for a total of **$60,000 USD**.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently, DAO governance remains a disjointed, messy, and confusing experience for delegates and tokenholders.** We believe that one of the main reasons for this is the clear lack of foundational DAO tooling that prioritizes true composability and aggregates data from multiple (even competing) offchain and onchain sources, thereby providing a more comprehensive and enjoyable user experience for DAO delegates and tokenholders. We believe that to achieve this, DAO tools should be free and open-source, operate under a non-profit entity that ideally has public financial records of its operations. At proposals.app, we strive to uphold these beliefs.\n\n[Andrei](https://andreiv.com) and I have been building DAO tools since mid-2023, starting with [Senate](https://x.com/SenateLabs), where we previously piloted two forum integrations (one with [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044), and another with [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680)), and more recently, we’ve been working on [proposals.app](https://x.com/proposalsapp), where we’ve developed dedicated tooling for Arbitrum DAO’s governance needs that was funded through [a questbook grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) last October. More specifically, we’ve designed and developed a [unified governance aggregator](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-proposals-app-govhack-brussels-winner/25370) that brings together, under the same platform, the discourse forum comments and both offchain and onchain votes, so that delegates can access the complete history of every proposal in Arbitrum DAO. We launched it publicly on April 5ᵗʰ at ETH Bucharest 2025, and you can check it out at [arbitrum.proposals.app](https://arbitrum.proposals.app) and share your thoughts about it with us in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/+U9QrY4L8wfNiMzA8).\n\nWe’re now proposing **a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO** to bring some of the exclusive proposals.app features we have in our app, to this governance forum. **We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum**, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of 12 months.\n\n![Demo of the three proposals.app feature integrations](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7e148a110ffeb8388f8bccdee73242f41437c45d.gif)\n\nWe believe that **these three features will enhance usability and accessibility** in this governance forum for all users, regardless of their level of maturity.\n\nThese three features, as demonstrated above, are:\n\n1. **Live Votes** – Show the live or latest vote at the top of the page for each forum topic in the proposals category\n2. **Voting Power Tags** – Show the voting power of each delegate, under their username, for every comment on the forum\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – Provide a way for forum visitors to subscribe to email notifications, receiving an email every time a new discussion is started, when an offchain or onchain vote begins, and when its voting period is nearing completion.\n\nWith these three proposals.app feature integrations in this forum, we believe will see **bigger governance participation and better engagement in discussions**, from a more diverse set of delegates and tokenholders, who will have more context about who is commenting on what, about when proposals are up to a vote and where and when to vote in each moment of the proposal lifecycle.\n\nWe shared a short demo of proposals.app and these three proposed feature integrations on the [Open Governance Call on June 3rd](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/june-3-2025-open-discussion-of-proposals-governance-call/29377?u=paulofonseca), and you can see the recording of that demo and presentation, as well as some Q&A, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MToHsWqQxs).\n\n## Rationale\n\nConstantly improving and caring for the governance processes in Arbitrum DAO is essential to maintain a healthy, engaged, resilient, and decentralized DAO. In Arbitrum DAO’s case, where tokenholders and delegates actually have on-chain control over protocol upgrades and treasury spending, it becomes even more critical that **they vote with as much context and information as possible in each and every vote.**\n\nAdditionally, **in token-weighted voting DAOs, not all voices carry the same weight.** Powerful delegates commenting and giving feedback on proposals are crucial signals of support. On the other hand, newly created forum accounts with no voting power, which are becoming more prevalent in the age of AI, make way more noise than signal and disrupt the discussion flow. Proposers and readers should be able to distinguish between the two and everything in between, much more easily.\n\nAs stated in [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), we should strive to follow our stated Community Values, and specifically:\n\n> **Neutral and open:** Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.\n\nWe believe it’s essential for Arbitrum DAO to have multiple governance platforms available to its tokenholders, delegates, and voters, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them with tools that suit their particular needs and help them engage in governance in an easier and clearer way.\n\nWe also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. Regarding the obvious matter of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue participating in governance permissionlessly. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) [is fully open source](https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp) and will continue to be. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** – Showing discourse users’ voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token** and **maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets** on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** – In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot’s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a “Setup Proposal Notifications” button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the **Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the **Proposal Notification Emails** integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**. After a successful offchain vote, we will move this proposal and publish an **onchain vote on Monday, June 23rd**, to start the voting period on Thursday, June 26th.\n\n===\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, we can kick off this work and start the timeline proposed above, **as early as July 15th.**\n\n===\n\nThis would mean that we could deliver all of the proposed scope, 1 month later, **on August 15th**.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nWe propose to build, maintain, and host these three feature integrations for Arbitrum for a minimum of 12 months. The total cost to the Arbitrum DAO, is **$60,000 USD**.\n\nHere is the cost breakdown:\n\n| Item | Amount |\n| ------------------- | ------: |\n| **Maintenance** 1 year (1 day of Design + 1 day of Development + 1 day of Testing, per month) | $48,000 USD |\n| **Hosting** 1 year (3 Servers, DNS, and Emails) | $12,000 USD |\n| **Total** | **$60,000 USD** |\n\nThe **Maintenance** fee includes 1 day per month of Design, 1 day per month of Development, and 1 day per month of Testing, to ensure we maintain these features with an up-to-date user experience and quality of service, and that we can incorporate the delegates’ future feedback on these proposals.app feature integrations.\n\nThe **Hosting** fee includes the monthly costs for all the infrastructure we use, which can be live-monitored on [status.proposals.app](https://status.proposals.app/).\n\nWe propose that the payment be done as a one-time payment of $60,000 USD.\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, the funds should be transferred either to **the MSS or the Arbitrum Foundation** (depending on the outcome of the current [Wind Down the MSS](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wind-down-the-mss-transfer-payment-responsibilities-to-the-arbitrum-foundation/29279) proposal), which would certify the delivery of the three feature integrations and release the payment after a successful deployment.\n\n## Pledge\n\nAndrei and Paulo pledge to continually work towards a future where DAO governance tools are genuinely credibly neutral. Therefore, our work is [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErD4sHs2Zk&list=PLaYDaaHm0oQGefGFDg8dt77ce7MQaUghG), fully [open-source](https://github.com/proposals-app), and happens with transparent [financials](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E). Additionally, proposals.app will soon be established as a non-profit entity, and we pledge never to accept venture capital funding. Until now, proposals.app has only received [a $43,000 USD grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) from Arbitrum DAO via Season 2 of the Domain Allocator grants on Questbook, as well as $6,000 USD for the first-place prize in the Arbitrum GovHack at ETHcc Brussels. No other funding, from any other source, was received, as shown in our [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E).\n\n## 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal through to the end.",

          "body": "# Let’s improve our governance forum with three proposals.app feature integrations\n\n## Abstract\n\n[proposals.app](https://proposals.app) proposes a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO to enhance the usability of this governance forum, so that delegates, tokenholders, and forum readers can have more context and information about our DAO proposals. We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of one year, for a total of **$60,000 USD**.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently, DAO governance remains a disjointed, messy, and confusing experience for delegates and tokenholders.** We believe that one of the main reasons for this is the clear lack of foundational DAO tooling that prioritizes true composability and aggregates data from multiple (even competing) offchain and onchain sources, thereby providing a more comprehensive and enjoyable user experience for DAO delegates and tokenholders. We believe that to achieve this, DAO tools should be free and open-source, operate under a non-profit entity that ideally has public financial records of its operations. At proposals.app, we strive to uphold these beliefs.\n\n[Andrei](https://andreiv.com) and I have been building DAO tools since mid-2023, starting with [Senate](https://x.com/SenateLabs), where we previously piloted two forum integrations (one with [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044), and another with [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680)), and more recently, we’ve been working on [proposals.app](https://x.com/proposalsapp), where we’ve developed dedicated tooling for Arbitrum DAO’s governance needs that was funded through [a questbook grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) last October. More specifically, we’ve designed and developed a [unified governance aggregator](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-proposals-app-govhack-brussels-winner/25370) that brings together, under the same platform, the discourse forum comments and both offchain and onchain votes, so that delegates can access the complete history of every proposal in Arbitrum DAO. We launched it publicly on April 5ᵗʰ at ETH Bucharest 2025, and you can check it out at [arbitrum.proposals.app](https://arbitrum.proposals.app) and share your thoughts about it with us in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/+U9QrY4L8wfNiMzA8).\n\nWe’re now proposing **a formal collaboration with Arbitrum DAO** to bring some of the exclusive proposals.app features we have in our app, to this governance forum. **We propose designing, developing, testing, and deploying three feature integrations in this governance forum**, as well as maintaining and hosting them for a period of 12 months.\n\n![Demo of the three proposals.app feature integrations](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7e148a110ffeb8388f8bccdee73242f41437c45d.gif)\n\nWe believe that **these three features will enhance usability and accessibility** in this governance forum for all users, regardless of their level of maturity.\n\nThese three features, as demonstrated above, are:\n\n1. **Live Votes** – Show the live or latest vote at the top of the page for each forum topic in the proposals category\n2. **Voting Power Tags** – Show the voting power of each delegate, under their username, for every comment on the forum\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – Provide a way for forum visitors to subscribe to email notifications, receiving an email every time a new discussion is started, when an offchain or onchain vote begins, and when its voting period is nearing completion.\n\nWith these three proposals.app feature integrations in this forum, we believe will see **bigger governance participation and better engagement in discussions**, from a more diverse set of delegates and tokenholders, who will have more context about who is commenting on what, about when proposals are up to a vote and where and when to vote in each moment of the proposal lifecycle.\n\nWe shared a short demo of proposals.app and these three proposed feature integrations on the [Open Governance Call on June 3rd](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/june-3-2025-open-discussion-of-proposals-governance-call/29377?u=paulofonseca), and you can see the recording of that demo and presentation, as well as some Q&A, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MToHsWqQxs).\n\n## Rationale\n\nConstantly improving and caring for the governance processes in Arbitrum DAO is essential to maintain a healthy, engaged, resilient, and decentralized DAO. In Arbitrum DAO’s case, where tokenholders and delegates actually have on-chain control over protocol upgrades and treasury spending, it becomes even more critical that **they vote with as much context and information as possible in each and every vote.**\n\nAdditionally, **in token-weighted voting DAOs, not all voices carry the same weight.** Powerful delegates commenting and giving feedback on proposals are crucial signals of support. On the other hand, newly created forum accounts with no voting power, which are becoming more prevalent in the age of AI, make way more noise than signal and disrupt the discussion flow. Proposers and readers should be able to distinguish between the two and everything in between, much more easily.\n\nAs stated in [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), we should strive to follow our stated Community Values, and specifically:\n\n> **Neutral and open:** Arbitrum governance should not pick winners and losers, but should foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition on Arbitrum chains.\n\nWe believe it’s essential for Arbitrum DAO to have multiple governance platforms available to its tokenholders, delegates, and voters, so that we can attract more and better delegates and voters by providing them with tools that suit their particular needs and help them engage in governance in an easier and clearer way.\n\nWe also strongly believe that at least one of those front-ends should be fully open-source. Regarding the obvious matter of the resilience of Arbitrum’s DAO governance, we believe there should be a fully open-source front-end for Arbitrum’s DAO governance that would allow delegates and voters to continue participating in governance permissionlessly. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) [is fully open source](https://github.com/proposals-app/proposalsapp) and will continue to be. [proposals.app](https://proposals.app/) and its future developments can also be self-hosted by anyone (like we’re doing now) under a new domain name, at any time, by anybody in the world.\n\n## Specifications\n\nTo implement these three forum feature integrations described above, we will create **three distinct Discourse theme components**, rather than Discourse plugins.\n\nThis way, admins of Discourse hosted instances (like the one for the Arbitrum DAO forum) can easily install each one of these feature integrations from a GitHub repo link (where the code will be fully open-source and auditable, of course) and manage the updates for each feature integration independently, as we evolve and maintain them after the initial deployment.\n\nAs mentioned above, this is how we previously integrated with the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-should-uniswap-enable-a-dedicated-governance-tool-for-delegates-and-voters/21044) and [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-proposal-for-senate-to-enable-dedicated-tooling-for-aave-governance/12680) governance forums, in the past.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nWe will design, develop, test, and deploy these 3 Discourse forum proposals.app feature integrations, **in the following order**:\n\n1. **Voting Power Tags** – Showing discourse users’ voting power alongside their usernames in every topic and post in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum. To achieve this, we must **retrieve all previous delegation data for the $ARB token** and **maintain a mapping between the top discourse users and voting wallets** on Arbitrum DAO. This voting power tag will always display the current voting power of each delegate by default. Upon clicking on it, the delegate's voting power at the time the comment was posted will be displayed instead.\n![Voting Power Tag showing Entropy's 25.7M ARB delegated voting power, at the time of posting this comment.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/0/02def7ab1879f9cda62eb6e95cc3a5b5efbfb34b.png)\n\n2. **Live Votes** – In every proposal posted in the Arbitrum DAO governance forum, which goes up for an offchain or onchain vote, we will display a component at the top of the forum proposal page, which shows that there is an active offchain or onchain vote, the current live results of that offchain or onchain vote, and a link to vote on it. To achieve this, we must **map all forum proposals and their respective Snapshot votes and onchain votes**, as well as index all voting data from either Snapshot’s API or the onchain Arbitrum DAO Governors (both the non-constitutional Arbitrum Treasury governor and the constitutional Arbitrum Core governor).\n![Live Vote results on the Quorum Threshold Reduction proposal in the forum, showing that there is an active offchain vote which ends in 4 hours, and directing delegates to the voting platform.](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/7/71103527189f961b216823e9244ce2bada38daa1_2_1380x608.png)\n\n3. **Proposal Notification Emails** – In the Arbitrum DAO governance forum homepage, we will display a “Setup Proposal Notifications” button, which will open a modal for forum users to subscribe to email notifications, so that they can receive timely emails whenever a new proposal discussion is posted on the forum, when an offchain or onchain vote starts, and when an offchain or onchain vote is about to end. To achieve this, **we need to maintain a GDPR-compliant list of emails and newsletters**, as well as **a dedicated subdomain and address** to send email notifications from, ensuring optimal email deliverability for those email notifications.\n![Modal to subscribe to proposal email notifications](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2bf33def77a835475b48e616c3167df940d980c6_2_1380x542.jpeg)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the successful approval of this proposal and the initial onchain transfer, we will hold a project kickoff call and begin building the first integration, the **Voting Power Tags**, which we can deploy and deliver within one month. Then we will work on the **Live Votes** integration, which we can also deploy and deliver within one month. Finally, we will work on the **Proposal Notification Emails** integration, which we will also deploy and deliver within one month.\n\nIn total, it will take us **1 month to deliver these three feature integrations** to the Arbitrum DAO after the project kickoff call, which should happen after a successful onchain vote. During this time, we will work with all Arbitrum DAO delegates to gather feedback on this functionality and improve it to meet your needs. After deploying all these integrations, we will **maintain and host them for a period of 12 months**.\n\n![Timeline](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/18798e403cebe644a8d714f49321de47ce8af6a4_2_1380x400.png)\n\nWe plan to put this proposal up for a temperature check **offchain vote on Thursday, June 12th**. After a successful offchain vote, we will move this proposal and publish an **onchain vote on Monday, June 23rd**, to start the voting period on Thursday, June 26th.\n\n===\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, we can kick off this work and start the timeline proposed above, **as early as July 15th.**\n\n===\n\nThis would mean that we could deliver all of the proposed scope, 1 month later, **on August 15th**.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nWe propose to build, maintain, and host these three feature integrations for Arbitrum for a minimum of 12 months. The total cost to the Arbitrum DAO, is **$60,000 USD**.\n\nHere is the cost breakdown:\n\n| Item | Amount |\n| ------------------- | ------: |\n| **Maintenance** 1 year (1 day of Design + 1 day of Development + 1 day of Testing, per month) | $48,000 USD |\n| **Hosting** 1 year (3 Servers, DNS, and Emails) | $12,000 USD |\n| **Total** | **$60,000 USD** |\n\nThe **Maintenance** fee includes 1 day per month of Design, 1 day per month of Development, and 1 day per month of Testing, to ensure we maintain these features with an up-to-date user experience and quality of service, and that we can incorporate the delegates’ future feedback on these proposals.app feature integrations.\n\nThe **Hosting** fee includes the monthly costs for all the infrastructure we use, which can be live-monitored on [status.proposals.app](https://status.proposals.app/).\n\nWe propose that the payment be done as a one-time payment of $60,000 USD.\n\nAfter a successful onchain vote, the funds should be transferred either to **the MSS or the Arbitrum Foundation** (depending on the outcome of the current [Wind Down the MSS](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wind-down-the-mss-transfer-payment-responsibilities-to-the-arbitrum-foundation/29279) proposal), which would certify the delivery of the three feature integrations and release the payment after a successful deployment.\n\n## Pledge\n\nAndrei and Paulo pledge to continually work towards a future where DAO governance tools are genuinely credibly neutral. Therefore, our work is [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErD4sHs2Zk&list=PLaYDaaHm0oQGefGFDg8dt77ce7MQaUghG), fully [open-source](https://github.com/proposals-app), and happens with transparent [financials](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E). Additionally, proposals.app will soon be established as a non-profit entity, and we pledge never to accept venture capital funding. Until now, proposals.app has only received [a $43,000 USD grant](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) from Arbitrum DAO via Season 2 of the Domain Allocator grants on Questbook, as well as $6,000 USD for the first-place prize in the Arbitrum GovHack at ETHcc Brussels. No other funding, from any other source, was received, as shown in our [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x6eFfD7b13e4D3c53b9C528d96Af0Fe8CfE32ba2E).\n\n## 🙏 Thank you\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal through to the end.",

              "body": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router\n### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings ([https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi/)). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings ([https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/)), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at [https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/))\n\n* USDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F)\n* sUSDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793)\n* Official USDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b)\n* Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610)\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity\\_MakerDAO\\_Arbitrum\\_Token\\_Bridge\\_audit.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf)\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora)\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n\\[1] [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208)\n\n\\[2] [https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef)\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal.

            "body": "# [CONSTITUTIONAL] Register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router\n### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings ([https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi/)). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings ([https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/)), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access.

              "name": "[CONSTITUTIONAL] Proposal: For Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router",
              "body": "### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings (https://spark.fi). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings (https://app.spark.fi/), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

            "name": "[CONSTITUTIONAL] Proposal: For Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router",
            "body": "### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings (https://spark.fi). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings (https://app.spark.fi/), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits. While this document isn’t gateway-specific, you can view the Sky Atlas Emergency Response System, maintained by Powerhouse, here:\nhttps://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.8_Emergency_Response_System/a1c2d773-f5f9-4e17-9da4-edd82ea4140b%7C0db3\n\n\n\n### Deployment Details\n\nWe propose the execution of the setGateways method [1] on the L1GatewayRouter contract [2] on Ethereum for both USDS and sUSDS tokens. This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n[1] https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at [https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/))\n\n* USDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F)\n* sUSDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793)\n* Official USDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b)\n* Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610)\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity\\_MakerDAO\\_Arbitrum\\_Token\\_Bridge\\_audit.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf)\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora)\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n\\[1] [https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208)\n\n\\[2] [https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef)\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings ([https://spark.fi](https://spark.fi/)). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings ([https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/)), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at [https://app.spark.fi/](https://app.spark.fi/))\n\n* USDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F)\n* sUSDS address on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - [https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e)\n* Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793)\n* Official USDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b)\n* Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - [https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610)\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity\\_MakerDAO\\_Arbitrum\\_Token\\_Bridge\\_audit.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf)\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\n[https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora](https://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora)\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits.

          "name": "[CONSTITUTIONAL] Proposal: For Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router",
          "body": "### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings (https://spark.fi). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings (https://app.spark.fi/), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits. While this document isn’t gateway-specific, you can view the Sky Atlas Emergency Response System, maintained by Powerhouse, here:\nhttps://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.8_Emergency_Response_System/a1c2d773-f5f9-4e17-9da4-edd82ea4140b%7C0db3\n\n\n\n### Deployment Details\n\nWe propose the execution of the setGateways method [1] on the L1GatewayRouter contract [2] on Ethereum for both USDS and sUSDS tokens. This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n[1] https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

              "name": "Updating the OpCo Foundation’s Operational Capability",
              "body": "# Introduction \n\nThe ArbitrumDAO approved the [OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) which allocates 30M ARB towards an operation company whose mandate is to operationalise, assist and oversee proposals approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe OpCo elections have been completed which appointed Patrick McCorry, A.J. Warner, and Frisson. The three council members have appointed Pedro Breuer as an OAT council member and are in final stage conversations with an identified candidate. All council members, alongside the Arbitrum Foundation, are now working towards operationalizing the OpCo entity and hiring the initial team to lead the organisation.\n\nIn the course of our work we reviewed the original OpCo proposal to fully internalize its mandate and operational capability. We discovered a number of restrictions during this process that may hinder the OpCo’s ability to fulfil its mission, attract the best talent who can contribute towards the OpCo’s success, and prevent the OpCo from proactively working on initiatives that can lead to future proposals in the DAO.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to go through each identified restriction, how it may impact the OpCo’s operational capability, and a proposed fix that can resolve the restrictions.\n\n## Restrictions Identified & Proposed Solutions\n\nWe’ll take this opportunity to go through each restriction alongside the proposed updates for the OpCo. Keep in mind, we will pick the problem statement from the OpCo proposal that most accurately reflects the problem, as sometimes the same restriction is repeated several times in the proposal.\n\n### Inability to Interact with Service Providers\n\n* **Problem:** It’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm).\n\nThe OpCo is unable to enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors unless it is related to its own operational needs.\n\nTo illustrate the issue, let’s consider an example where a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO and the OpCo thinks it may be valuable for the ecosystem. Unfortunately, the OpCo cannot engage with a consulting firm to evaluate the idea. The only option available for OpCo is to encourage the contributor to seek permission (and potential funding from exploratory work) from the DAO.\n\nWe believe this situation is counter to the OpCo’s core mandate to support preliminary work on potentially promising proposals before it reaches the DAO. It should have the freedom to engage third parties, when necessary, to work on initiatives that it believes will receive a positive response from the DAO.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo has the authority to enter contracts with service providers or individual contributors for any matter it deems necessary to fulfil its mandate to support the ArbitrumDAO. The OAT will offer its recommendation to help adjudicate agreements.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to enter agreements with service providers or individual contributors alongside allowing the OAT to provide oversight on whether the agreement indeed fulfils the mandate of supporting the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Restrictive Treasury Spend\n\n* **Problem:** OpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee.\n\nThe OpCo restricts its budget to only be used for operational costs related to employees, running the organisation, and administrative costs.\n\nWe can re-use the previous example to highlight the issue. Let’s assume a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO. The OpCo cannot offer a grant to the contributor to investigate the idea further, in a similar manner to M&A Pilot or the Arbitrum Venture Initiative Pilot. To obtain any exploratory funding, the OpCo will need to work with the contributor on a proposal for the DAO, as opposed to offering its own funds to support preliminary work.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s capital should be reserved to cover the costs of administrative and operational duties as approved by the OAT, but any excess capital that is available can be used on a discretionary basis to fulfil its mandate as a proactive entity in the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to spend funds on a discretionary basis with oversight of the OAT. We believe this is mandatory to ensure the OpCo can be ‘proactive, meaning if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developers could be made, it can propose a strategy’ as written in the original proposal.\n\n### Compensation for OpCo Employees\n\n* **Problem:** 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n\nIn many organisations, it is common for employees to have a base salary, token agreement that vests over time as a structure of the initial compensation package, and a bonus structure for good performance. We believe the bonus pool should be available to support token agreements as well as bonuses.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** 4M ARB allocated to a compensation pool and bonus pool for internal employees and the OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). The compensation pool should be paid out in ARB with a vesting schedule, while the bonus pool shall be denominated in ARB, available for employees only and shall be performance-based. The exact split between the compensation pool and bonus pool shall be determined by the OAT Council.\n\nThis will offer the optionality to offer future employees a token vesting agreement alongside a bonus structure for performance related compensation.\n\n### Restrictions Around Council Elections.\n\n* **Problem:** Any individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-observing seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\nThe initial restrictions were crafted to prevent conflicts of interests for OAT council members, but as we have witnessed in the previous election, several promising candidates who generally have the best interests in Arbitrum in mind were unable to apply and join the OAT. For example, tnorm was unable to apply as it would restrict Gauntlet’s ability to enter service level agreements.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** An individual will be entitled to run as a candidate for the election. No single organisation should be overly represented in the OAT. There should be no more than 1 candidate associated with a single entity. No candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO which include, but not limited to: affiliates with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others. If a candidate is elected on behalf of an organisation, then the OAT membership is tied to them and cannot be rotated to someone else in the organisation. It will be up to the current OAT to enforce the above policy, and if a candidate is excluded from the election, then the rationale must be publicly disclosed to the ArbitrumDAO. If the DAO disagrees, they can initiate a vote with a non-constitutional quorum to overturn the OAT’s decision to exclude a candidate.\n\nThe proposed fix is inspired by the eligibility policy that is applied to Arbitrum’s Security Council as outlined in the ArbitrumDAO’s constitution. It relies on the current OAT to enforce the policy, but if the ArbitrumDAO disagrees with the decision, they can overturn with a vote that achieves a non-constitutional quorum.\n\nOAT members are no longer required to relinquish their role as contributors within the ArbitrumDAO and are allowed to be a member of other DAO-adjacent entity oversight committees. The motivation is to ensure talented individuals can continue to support initiatives in the ArbitrumDAO while offering their expertise to help the OAT navigate its own future. Of course, a contributor may voluntarily decide to relinquish some roles depending on time commitments, to ensure they can dedicate themselves to this role.\n\nFinally, if an OAT member is affiliated with an entity, that entity is no longer prevented from engaging in service provider contracts with the OpCo. Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum’s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo’s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO’s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.",

            "name": "Updating the OpCo Foundation’s Operational Capability",
            "body": "# Introduction \n\nThe ArbitrumDAO approved the [OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) which allocates 30M ARB towards an operation company whose mandate is to operationalise, assist and oversee proposals approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe OpCo elections have been completed which appointed Patrick McCorry, A.J. Warner, and Frisson. The three council members have appointed Pedro Breuer as an OAT council member and are in final stage conversations with an identified candidate. All council members, alongside the Arbitrum Foundation, are now working towards operationalizing the OpCo entity and hiring the initial team to lead the organisation.\n\nIn the course of our work we reviewed the original OpCo proposal to fully internalize its mandate and operational capability. We discovered a number of restrictions during this process that may hinder the OpCo’s ability to fulfil its mission, attract the best talent who can contribute towards the OpCo’s success, and prevent the OpCo from proactively working on initiatives that can lead to future proposals in the DAO.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to go through each identified restriction, how it may impact the OpCo’s operational capability, and a proposed fix that can resolve the restrictions.\n\n## Restrictions Identified & Proposed Solutions\n\nWe’ll take this opportunity to go through each restriction alongside the proposed updates for the OpCo. Keep in mind, we will pick the problem statement from the OpCo proposal that most accurately reflects the problem, as sometimes the same restriction is repeated several times in the proposal.\n\n### Inability to Interact with Service Providers\n\n* **Problem:** It’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm).\n\nThe OpCo is unable to enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors unless it is related to its own operational needs.\n\nTo illustrate the issue, let’s consider an example where a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO and the OpCo thinks it may be valuable for the ecosystem. Unfortunately, the OpCo cannot engage with a consulting firm to evaluate the idea. The only option available for OpCo is to encourage the contributor to seek permission (and potential funding from exploratory work) from the DAO.\n\nWe believe this situation is counter to the OpCo’s core mandate to support preliminary work on potentially promising proposals before it reaches the DAO. It should have the freedom to engage third parties, when necessary, to work on initiatives that it believes will receive a positive response from the DAO.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo has the authority to enter contracts with service providers or individual contributors for any matter it deems necessary to fulfil its mandate to support the ArbitrumDAO. The OAT will offer its recommendation to help adjudicate agreements.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to enter agreements with service providers or individual contributors alongside allowing the OAT to provide oversight on whether the agreement indeed fulfils the mandate of supporting the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Restrictive Treasury Spend\n\n* **Problem:** OpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee.\n\nThe OpCo restricts its budget to only be used for operational costs related to employees, running the organisation, and administrative costs.\n\nWe can re-use the previous example to highlight the issue. Let’s assume a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO. The OpCo cannot offer a grant to the contributor to investigate the idea further, in a similar manner to M&A Pilot or the Arbitrum Venture Initiative Pilot. To obtain any exploratory funding, the OpCo will need to work with the contributor on a proposal for the DAO, as opposed to offering its own funds to support preliminary work.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s capital should be reserved to cover the costs of administrative and operational duties as approved by the OAT, but any excess capital that is available can be used on a discretionary basis to fulfil its mandate as a proactive entity in the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to spend funds on a discretionary basis with oversight of the OAT. We believe this is mandatory to ensure the OpCo can be ‘proactive, meaning if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developers could be made, it can propose a strategy’ as written in the original proposal.\n\n### Compensation for OpCo Employees\n\n* **Problem:** 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n\nIn many organisations, it is common for employees to have a base salary, token agreement that vests over time as a structure of the initial compensation package, and a bonus structure for good performance. We believe the bonus pool should be available to support token agreements as well as bonuses.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** 4M ARB allocated to a compensation pool and bonus pool for internal employees and the OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). The compensation pool should be paid out in ARB with a vesting schedule, while the bonus pool shall be denominated in ARB, available for employees only and shall be performance-based. The exact split between the compensation pool and bonus pool shall be determined by the OAT Council.\n\nThis will offer the optionality to offer future employees a token vesting agreement alongside a bonus structure for performance related compensation.\n\n### Restrictions Around Council Elections.\n\n* **Problem:** Any individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-observing seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\nThe initial restrictions were crafted to prevent conflicts of interests for OAT council members, but as we have witnessed in the previous election, several promising candidates who generally have the best interests in Arbitrum in mind were unable to apply and join the OAT. For example, tnorm was unable to apply as it would restrict Gauntlet’s ability to enter service level agreements.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** An individual will be entitled to run as a candidate for the election. No single organisation should be overly represented in the OAT. There should be no more than 1 candidate associated with a single entity. No candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO which include, but not limited to: affiliates with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others. If a candidate is elected on behalf of an organisation, then the OAT membership is tied to them and cannot be rotated to someone else in the organisation. It will be up to the current OAT to enforce the above policy, and if a candidate is excluded from the election, then the rationale must be publicly disclosed to the ArbitrumDAO. If the DAO disagrees, they can initiate a vote with a non-constitutional quorum to overturn the OAT’s decision to exclude a candidate.\n\nThe proposed fix is inspired by the eligibility policy that is applied to Arbitrum’s Security Council as outlined in the ArbitrumDAO’s constitution. It relies on the current OAT to enforce the policy, but if the ArbitrumDAO disagrees with the decision, they can overturn with a vote that achieves a non-constitutional quorum.\n\nOAT members are no longer required to relinquish their role as contributors within the ArbitrumDAO and are allowed to be a member of other DAO-adjacent entity oversight committees. The motivation is to ensure talented individuals can continue to support initiatives in the ArbitrumDAO while offering their expertise to help the OAT navigate its own future. Of course, a contributor may voluntarily decide to relinquish some roles depending on time commitments, to ensure they can dedicate themselves to this role.\n\nFinally, if an OAT member is affiliated with an entity, that entity is no longer prevented from engaging in service provider contracts with the OpCo. Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum’s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo’s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO’s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.",

            "body": "# Introduction \n\nThe ArbitrumDAO approved the [OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) which allocates 30M ARB towards an operation company whose mandate is to operationalise, assist and oversee proposals approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe OpCo elections have been completed which appointed Patrick McCorry, A.J. Warner, and Frisson. The three council members have appointed Pedro Breuer as an OAT council member and are in final stage conversations with an identified candidate. All council members, alongside the Arbitrum Foundation, are now working towards operationalizing the OpCo entity and hiring the initial team to lead the organisation.\n\nIn the course of our work we reviewed the original OpCo proposal to fully internalize its mandate and operational capability. We discovered a number of restrictions during this process that may hinder the OpCo’s ability to fulfil its mission, attract the best talent who can contribute towards the OpCo’s success, and prevent the OpCo from proactively working on initiatives that can lead to future proposals in the DAO.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to go through each identified restriction, how it may impact the OpCo’s operational capability, and a proposed fix that can resolve the restrictions.\n\n## Restrictions Identified & Proposed Solutions\n\nWe’ll take this opportunity to go through each restriction alongside the proposed updates for the OpCo. Keep in mind, we will pick the problem statement from the OpCo proposal that most accurately reflects the problem, as sometimes the same restriction is repeated several times in the proposal.\n\n### Inability to Interact with Service Providers\n\n* **Problem:** It’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm).\n\nThe OpCo is unable to enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors unless it is related to its own operational needs.\n\nTo illustrate the issue, let’s consider an example where a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO and the OpCo thinks it may be valuable for the ecosystem. Unfortunately, the OpCo cannot engage with a consulting firm to evaluate the idea. The only option available for OpCo is to encourage the contributor to seek permission (and potential funding from exploratory work) from the DAO.\n\nWe believe this situation is counter to the OpCo’s core mandate to support preliminary work on potentially promising proposals before it reaches the DAO. It should have the freedom to engage third parties, when necessary, to work on initiatives that it believes will receive a positive response from the DAO.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo has the authority to enter contracts with service providers or individual contributors for any matter it deems necessary to fulfil its mandate to support the ArbitrumDAO. The OAT will offer its recommendation to help adjudicate agreements.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to enter agreements with service providers or individual contributors alongside allowing the OAT to provide oversight on whether the agreement indeed fulfils the mandate of supporting the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Restrictive Treasury Spend\n\n* **Problem:** OpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee.\n\nThe OpCo restricts its budget to only be used for operational costs related to employees, running the organisation, and administrative costs.\n\nWe can re-use the previous example to highlight the issue. Let’s assume a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO. The OpCo cannot offer a grant to the contributor to investigate the idea further, in a similar manner to M&A Pilot or the Arbitrum Venture Initiative Pilot. To obtain any exploratory funding, the OpCo will need to work with the contributor on a proposal for the DAO, as opposed to offering its own funds to support preliminary work.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s capital should be reserved to cover the costs of administrative and operational duties as approved by the OAT, but any excess capital that is available can be used on a discretionary basis to fulfil its mandate as a proactive entity in the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to spend funds on a discretionary basis with oversight of the OAT. We believe this is mandatory to ensure the OpCo can be ‘proactive, meaning if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developers could be made, it can propose a strategy’ as written in the original proposal.\n\n### Compensation for OpCo Employees\n\n* **Problem:** 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n\nIn many organisations, it is common for employees to have a base salary, token agreement that vests over time as a structure of the initial compensation package, and a bonus structure for good performance. We believe the bonus pool should be available to support token agreements as well as bonuses.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** 4M ARB allocated to a compensation pool and bonus pool for internal employees and the OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). The compensation pool should be paid out in ARB with a vesting schedule, while the bonus pool shall be denominated in ARB, available for employees only and shall be performance-based. The exact split between the compensation pool and bonus pool shall be determined by the OAT Council.\n\nThis will offer the optionality to offer future employees a token vesting agreement alongside a bonus structure for performance related compensation.\n\n### Restrictions Around Council Elections.\n\n* **Problem:** Any individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-observing seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\nThe initial restrictions were crafted to prevent conflicts of interests for OAT council members, but as we have witnessed in the previous election, several promising candidates who generally have the best interests in Arbitrum in mind were unable to apply and join the OAT. For example, tnorm was unable to apply as it would restrict Gauntlet’s ability to enter service level agreements.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** An individual will be entitled to run as a candidate for the election. No single organisation should be overly represented in the OAT. There should be no more than 1 candidate associated with a single entity. No candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO which include, but not limited to: affiliates with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others. If a candidate is elected on behalf of an organisation, then the OAT membership is tied to them and cannot be rotated to someone else in the organisation. It will be up to the current OAT to enforce the above policy, and if a candidate is excluded from the election, then the rationale must be publicly disclosed to the ArbitrumDAO. If the DAO disagrees, they can initiate a vote with a non-constitutional quorum to overturn the OAT’s decision to exclude a candidate.\n\nThe proposed fix is inspired by the eligibility policy that is applied to Arbitrum’s Security Council as outlined in the ArbitrumDAO’s constitution. It relies on the current OAT to enforce the policy, but if the ArbitrumDAO disagrees with the decision, they can overturn with a vote that achieves a non-constitutional quorum.\n\nOAT members are no longer required to relinquish their role as contributors within the ArbitrumDAO and are allowed to be a member of other DAO-adjacent entity oversight committees. The motivation is to ensure talented individuals can continue to support initiatives in the ArbitrumDAO while offering their expertise to help the OAT navigate its own future. Of course, a contributor may voluntarily decide to relinquish some roles depending on time commitments, to ensure they can dedicate themselves to this role.\n\nFinally, if an OAT member is affiliated with an entity, that entity is no longer prevented from engaging in service provider contracts with the OpCo. Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum’s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo’s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO’s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.",

          "name": "Updating the OpCo Foundation’s Operational Capability",
          "body": "# Introduction \n\nThe ArbitrumDAO approved the [OpCo: A DAO-adjacent Entity for Strategy Execution](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) which allocates 30M ARB towards an operation company whose mandate is to operationalise, assist and oversee proposals approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe OpCo elections have been completed which appointed Patrick McCorry, A.J. Warner, and Frisson. The three council members have appointed Pedro Breuer as an OAT council member and are in final stage conversations with an identified candidate. All council members, alongside the Arbitrum Foundation, are now working towards operationalizing the OpCo entity and hiring the initial team to lead the organisation.\n\nIn the course of our work we reviewed the original OpCo proposal to fully internalize its mandate and operational capability. We discovered a number of restrictions during this process that may hinder the OpCo’s ability to fulfil its mission, attract the best talent who can contribute towards the OpCo’s success, and prevent the OpCo from proactively working on initiatives that can lead to future proposals in the DAO.\n\nWe want to take this opportunity to go through each identified restriction, how it may impact the OpCo’s operational capability, and a proposed fix that can resolve the restrictions.\n\n## Restrictions Identified & Proposed Solutions\n\nWe’ll take this opportunity to go through each restriction alongside the proposed updates for the OpCo. Keep in mind, we will pick the problem statement from the OpCo proposal that most accurately reflects the problem, as sometimes the same restriction is repeated several times in the proposal.\n\n### Inability to Interact with Service Providers\n\n* **Problem:** It’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm).\n\nThe OpCo is unable to enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors unless it is related to its own operational needs.\n\nTo illustrate the issue, let’s consider an example where a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO and the OpCo thinks it may be valuable for the ecosystem. Unfortunately, the OpCo cannot engage with a consulting firm to evaluate the idea. The only option available for OpCo is to encourage the contributor to seek permission (and potential funding from exploratory work) from the DAO.\n\nWe believe this situation is counter to the OpCo’s core mandate to support preliminary work on potentially promising proposals before it reaches the DAO. It should have the freedom to engage third parties, when necessary, to work on initiatives that it believes will receive a positive response from the DAO.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo has the authority to enter contracts with service providers or individual contributors for any matter it deems necessary to fulfil its mandate to support the ArbitrumDAO. The OAT will offer its recommendation to help adjudicate agreements.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to enter agreements with service providers or individual contributors alongside allowing the OAT to provide oversight on whether the agreement indeed fulfils the mandate of supporting the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Restrictive Treasury Spend\n\n* **Problem:** OpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee.\n\nThe OpCo restricts its budget to only be used for operational costs related to employees, running the organisation, and administrative costs.\n\nWe can re-use the previous example to highlight the issue. Let’s assume a contributor approaches the OpCo with a proposal for the DAO. The OpCo cannot offer a grant to the contributor to investigate the idea further, in a similar manner to M&A Pilot or the Arbitrum Venture Initiative Pilot. To obtain any exploratory funding, the OpCo will need to work with the contributor on a proposal for the DAO, as opposed to offering its own funds to support preliminary work.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s capital should be reserved to cover the costs of administrative and operational duties as approved by the OAT, but any excess capital that is available can be used on a discretionary basis to fulfil its mandate as a proactive entity in the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThis proposed fix will enable the OpCo to spend funds on a discretionary basis with oversight of the OAT. We believe this is mandatory to ensure the OpCo can be ‘proactive, meaning if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developers could be made, it can propose a strategy’ as written in the original proposal.\n\n### Compensation for OpCo Employees\n\n* **Problem:** 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n\nIn many organisations, it is common for employees to have a base salary, token agreement that vests over time as a structure of the initial compensation package, and a bonus structure for good performance. We believe the bonus pool should be available to support token agreements as well as bonuses.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** 4M ARB allocated to a compensation pool and bonus pool for internal employees and the OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). The compensation pool should be paid out in ARB with a vesting schedule, while the bonus pool shall be denominated in ARB, available for employees only and shall be performance-based. The exact split between the compensation pool and bonus pool shall be determined by the OAT Council.\n\nThis will offer the optionality to offer future employees a token vesting agreement alongside a bonus structure for performance related compensation.\n\n### Restrictions Around Council Elections.\n\n* **Problem:** Any individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-observing seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\nThe initial restrictions were crafted to prevent conflicts of interests for OAT council members, but as we have witnessed in the previous election, several promising candidates who generally have the best interests in Arbitrum in mind were unable to apply and join the OAT. For example, tnorm was unable to apply as it would restrict Gauntlet’s ability to enter service level agreements.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** An individual will be entitled to run as a candidate for the election. No single organisation should be overly represented in the OAT. There should be no more than 1 candidate associated with a single entity. No candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO which include, but not limited to: affiliates with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others. If a candidate is elected on behalf of an organisation, then the OAT membership is tied to them and cannot be rotated to someone else in the organisation. It will be up to the current OAT to enforce the above policy, and if a candidate is excluded from the election, then the rationale must be publicly disclosed to the ArbitrumDAO. If the DAO disagrees, they can initiate a vote with a non-constitutional quorum to overturn the OAT’s decision to exclude a candidate.\n\nThe proposed fix is inspired by the eligibility policy that is applied to Arbitrum’s Security Council as outlined in the ArbitrumDAO’s constitution. It relies on the current OAT to enforce the policy, but if the ArbitrumDAO disagrees with the decision, they can overturn with a vote that achieves a non-constitutional quorum.\n\nOAT members are no longer required to relinquish their role as contributors within the ArbitrumDAO and are allowed to be a member of other DAO-adjacent entity oversight committees. The motivation is to ensure talented individuals can continue to support initiatives in the ArbitrumDAO while offering their expertise to help the OAT navigate its own future. Of course, a contributor may voluntarily decide to relinquish some roles depending on time commitments, to ensure they can dedicate themselves to this role.\n\nFinally, if an OAT member is affiliated with an entity, that entity is no longer prevented from engaging in service provider contracts with the OpCo. Keep in mind, there will be a conflict of interest policy that will require a conflicted OAT member to recuse themselves on all matters related to that entity or any service agreement signed with OpCo.\n\n### Declaring Conflict of Interest\n\n* **Problem:** Required to maintain a public record of all actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe believe this requirement is overkill as a requirement for the OAT elections. It is important that direct conflicts of interests are disclosed (e.g., working at a competitor), but potential conflicts of interests can become impractical for certain user profiles (e.g., prolific investors) who have valuable networks and skillsets that can be beneficial to the council. It is easier for potential conflicts to be handled within the council as they must be disclosed when necessary and the conflicted OAT member must exclude themselves from the matter.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed fix:** All OAT members are required to publicly disclose actual conflicts of interests (e.g., employed by a competitor) at the time of proposing themselves as a candidate for the OAT election. Potential conflicts of interest should be privately declared, when required and if elected as an OAT member, with the OAT council. If the remaining OAT council believe it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be excluded from voting.\n\nOur proposed fix aims to strike a balance. Candidates for the OAT election are required to publicly disclose direct conflicts, in a similar manner as Arbitrum’s Security Council elections. If the candidate is elected as an OAT member, then they can disclose potential conflicts of interests with the remaining members of the OAT council. If the OAT council believes it is indeed a conflict of interest, then the conflicted OAT member will be forced to recluse themselves from the matter at hand.\n\n### Ecosystem Support or Financial Management only\n\n* **Problem:** As initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates.\n\nThe original proposal fixed the mandate of OpCo to only focus on ecosystem support or financial management unless there is an additional proposal that expands its scope. We are weary about pigeon-holing the OpCo’s mandate before it is operational as there are many verticals that can arise that the OpCo is best suited to tackle, but it is unable to do so without an explicit vote by the ArbitrumDAO. For example, taking the reins on governance related matters in the ArbitrumDAO seems like a natural fit for OpCo, but at present it is unable to take up that mantle due to this restriction.\n\nAdditionally, since the OpCo will offer oversight capabilities for proposals passed by the ArbitrumDAO and executed by others (like AAEs, contributors, etc), it should have the full freedom to take that on without contention on whether it is focused on ecosystem support, financial management or whether the DAO needs to approve a new domain for OpCo. In fact, as written in the proposal, the OpCo should proactively work on identifying opportunities and we believe restricting the OpCo to specific categories can be problematic in this pursuit.\n\nWe believe it should be fixed with the following:\n\n* **Proposed Fix:** OpCo’s core mandate is to work on, facilitate, and provide operational and oversight support for strategies that have the potential to benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe proposed fix will allow the OpCo to proactively work on and experiment with new strategies and verticals that it believes the ArbitrumDAO may positively vote on in the future. For example, it can begin work on a proposal focused on improving governance in the DAO or a future grant program for public goods. This can enable the OpCo to operate in a flexible manner with rough consensus amongst delegates and the OAT on initiatives it believes will ultimately benefit the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nOf course, to carry out any large initiative, the OpCo will still need to request funds from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury, so this flexibility should be viewed as enabling small-scale experiments by the OpCo and proactive work towards acquiring future funding when it is required on domains that it believes is important for the DAO’s success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed fixes should enable the OpCo to voluntarily enter service agreements with service providers or individual contributors using discretionary funding available to help access additional resources to fulfil its mandate to the DAO. Additionally, it helps fix the compensation structure for OpCo employees to be in line with industry standards and relaxes restrictions for OAT council elections to enable attract more candidates who have the interests of Arbitrun in mind.",
