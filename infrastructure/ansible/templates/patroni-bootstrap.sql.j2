-- Patroni Bootstrap SQL Script
-- Purpose: Initial database setup executed during PostgreSQL cluster initialization.
--          Creates required roles, sets permissions, and prepares the database
--          for the ProposalsApp application.
--
-- Execution context:
-- - Runs as postgres superuser
-- - Executed via patroni-post-init.sh during cluster bootstrap
-- - Only runs once when creating a new cluster from scratch
--
-- Note: Uses DO blocks to make operations idempotent - safe to run multiple times

-- Create Application Role
-- proposalsapp: Main application user with database creation privileges

-- Allow proposalsapp to monitor database performance

-- Database Creation Note:
-- The actual proposalsapp database is created later in the Ansible playbook
-- after the cluster is fully initialized and stable. This ensures proper
-- ownership and allows for database-specific configuration.

-- Create Extensions in postgres database
-- pg_stat_statements needs to be available in the postgres database for global statistics
-- Note: This will only work if pg_stat_statements is in shared_preload_libraries
